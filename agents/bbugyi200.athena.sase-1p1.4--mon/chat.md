[validate_sase_core_rs_version] sase-core checkout is ahead of sase's compatibility window: source version 0.43.0 from /home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/sase-org/sase/sase_14/sase/repos/linked/sase-core/Cargo.toml does not satisfy `sase`'s `sase-core-rs==0.42.7` dependency in pyproject.toml. No action is needed: editable installs build from the checkout regardless, and `tools/ratchet_core_pin` moves the published pin on the release branch at release time.
[setup] Note: the sase-core checkout is ahead of the published sase-core-rs pin in pyproject.toml; dev installs build from /home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/sase-org/sase/sase_14/sase/repos/linked/sase-core regardless. This is normal — the release-branch reconciler ratchets the published pin at release time, so no action is needed here.

Private test bounded waits are retired. Use sase.ace.testing.wait.wait_for for raw Textual pilots, sase.ace.testing.set_agent_prompt_document for TUI prompt-panel document injection, or give non-pilot harness waits a domain-specific name. Positive literal test sleeps must use an inline '# sase-test-wait: <reason>' pragma, or be replaced by an observable wait.
