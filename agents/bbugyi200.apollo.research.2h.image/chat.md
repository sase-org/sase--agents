%clan(research.2h, tribe=research, summary=[[[bold]RESEARCH PROMPT:[/bold] I've been thinking about how sase integrates with my task managment system (see the

sase (and agent orchestration in general) and task management systems. I am at the very

types of use-cases would be unlocked by a deeper, task-management system agnostic sase

- It would be useful to be able to tag an Obsidian task as ready to be worked and have a

  could then be added to that Obsidian task by the integration and the task would be
  marked as pending (i.e. `[/]`).

  are confident they understand, it would be useful if an agent could propose
  adjustments to that task to further clarify the requirements. If accepted this would
  then add the appropriate tag, which automatically triggers a sase agent launch. This
  sase launch proposal might correspond with a prompt that asks an agent to plan out and
  implement the work or it could be, for example, a research swarm proposal (using the
  `#research_swarm` macro swarm).

When you author or carry over Mermaid diagrams, load `/mermaid_diagrams` before
drafting, even when no image or diagrams companion runs. The skill has the shared
figure-selection, styling, and PDF-render review rules. If the provider skill is not
deployed, verify the edited plugin's guide with `sase macro show skill/mermaid_diagrams --format raw` (or
`sase macro show /mermaid_diagrams --format raw`) and use the form this host supports.
This guidance does not enable a companion diagrams agent.

The researchers' registered reports:

{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "markdown" and a.label and a.label.startswith("research:") %}
- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} source_path={{ a.source_path }} path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }}
{% endfor %}

Month directory (create it if missing):

$(sase repo path research --ensure)/$(date +%Y%m)

Steps:

1. From the registered reports above, identify exactly one report per expected suffix
   in cdx, cld, grk, mus, gem, belonging to this
   dispatch's `research.2h.cdx`, `research.2h.cld`, `research.2h.grk`, `research.2h.mus`, `research.2h.gem` dependencies, matching by `wait_name` and the canonical research
   label's existing `__<suffix>.md` suffix. Never reassign suffixes from list order.
   Open the research repo with `/sase_repo`, then read each report through its canonical
   research reference (or the `ref` field's `file:<id>` reference if the original has
   moved) using `sase artifact read`. Do not read predecessor chat transcripts. If the
   records above do not identify exactly one report per expected suffix, stop and report
   the missing or ambiguous input instead of guessing.
2. Research the request yourself, prioritizing gaps, weak evidence, and disagreements
   between the reports.
3. Pick a descriptive stem `<name>` that collides with nothing in the month directory
   (do NOT end the name with `_consolidated` or `_<YYYYmmdd>` or anything similar unless
   it relates to the research topic), create `<month-dir>/<name>/`, and move each report
   inside it as `<name>__<suffix>.md`, preserving its existing suffix. Each report's
   `source_path` is provenance for where it lives in your own opened research checkout;
   resolve its canonical repo-relative path there before moving it. Never modify the
   other agents' checkouts or the stored snapshot recorded at `ref` — only the copy in
   your own checkout moves. Preserve every file and never overwrite: on any collision,
   pick a different stem first.
4. Write the consolidated report to `<name>/<name>__final.md`: merge the strongest findings
   from every report above and your own research, resolve conflicts, cut duplication,
   and add missing critical context without unnecessary length.

   Do not create `<name>/<name>.md`, not even as a placeholder, because the linker
   agent `research.2h.linker` publishes it from your report.

5. After the write succeeds, register the consolidated report as a durable snapshot so
   the linker agent, `research.2h.linker`, can find it:

   sase artifact create -p "<absolute-report-path>" -l "research:<repo-relative-report-path>"

   Use the consolidated report's actual absolute path and its path relative to the
   research repo root, for example `research:202609/<name>/<name>__final.md`. Register
   only the consolidated report, and do not pass `--move`. If registration fails,
   report that failure; do not report the task as fully complete.

Final layout:

```text
<month-dir>/<name>/
├── <name>__cdx.md
├── <name>__cld.md
├── <name>__grk.md
├── <name>__mus.md
├── <name>__gem.md
└── <name>__final.md
```

### Assistant

Reading the five researcher reports now; then I'll do my own gap research and merge them.

All five reports are in. Next I'm checking the points where they disagree against the bob-cli source, the SASE docs, and the vault.

Two findings from the vault so far: no open task line carries a `#sase` tag, and three already carry `#research_swarm`. Looking at those three now.

Verification is finished. Now moving the five reports into the named directory in the research checkout.

Figure 1 fits at 78% and reads clearly. Figure 2 is too wide (53% fit), so I'm shortening its labels.

Both figures now fit: lifecycle at 78%, write ownership at 82%. Writing the consolidated report.

Report written and layout complete. Registering the consolidated report as an artifact.

Registered. Now submitting the final declaration.

The consolidated report is written and registered. In short: yes, a deeper integration is a good idea, as long as you choose what agents work on, you settle every result, and SASE only runs and reports the work.

The connection is real. SASE has quietly built a second to-do system for its agents (beads, triage gates, the Goals design) that runs in parallel to Bob. Your own October study of `sase.md` found the problem there was "ownership, not volume." The right shape is one place for your commitments (Bob), SASE as the engine that runs agents, and a thin layer between them that records what you've handed off. Launching agents isn't the bottleneck, since you already start dozens a day. The gain is getting the result back onto the task, where you check it in the Pending review you already do daily.

**Three of your ideas need adjusting first** (all checked against bob-cli and the vault):
- **Where `#q` answers go:** Bob rewrites the Highlights block of a reference note on every sync, so answers written inside it would be lost. Put them in the same note, outside that block. Later, Bob can keep its own answers log and show each answer under its question.
- **How a task gets to `[/]`:** Bob has no command that can set it from automation. Today it only happens when you close a Pomodoro, and reusing that would invent Pomodoro history. Bob needs one small "agent work returned" command that SASE runs after the agent finishes; the agent itself never writes to the vault.
- **Which tag starts an agent:** Use a namespaced family like `#sase/research` or `#sase/plan`, never bare `#sase`. Seven open tasks mention macros like `` `#research_swarm` `` in their text because they're tasks *about* those macros. A bridge that read task text as a prompt would launch them.

**Use cases worth testing beyond your three:**
- prep packs for tasks only you can do (a call, a purchase, an application);
- an "already done?" check that proposes closing finished tasks with evidence;
- SASE's own asks (triage items, needed reinstalls) turning into Bob tasks;
- watchers that resurface a task when the PR, CI run or reply it's waiting on arrives;
- deferred handoffs that run when a task's scheduled date arrives;
- using each of your accept/reject decisions as a signal for which models and modes work for which kinds of task.

**Recommended order:**
1. A dry run that launches and writes nothing.
2. Read-only research tasks and `#q` answers, with no SASE core changes.
3. The new Bob commands, plus plan-only handoffs.
4. Agent-proposed clarifications, capped at about 3 a day and approved through gates.
5. The shared contract in sase-core, then GitHub labels as the second tracker.

Your review time is the real limit: stop admitting new work while Pending sits at Bob's cap of 10. If fewer than 40% of returns are accepted after about 30 items, fall back to proposal-only modes.

The report has two diagrams that render cleanly in the PDF. It ends with seven decisions only you can make, including whether `sase.md` or beads owns SASE work and whether personal tasks are in scope. One finding from the reports turned out overstated: one researcher counted about 1,563 `#sase` tags, but no open task carries it, only 100 archived ones. The advice against using bare `#sase` still holds for the reasons above.

**Layout:** the five reports are moved into `202610/sase_task_system_delegation_layer/` as `sase_task_system_delegation_layer__{cdx,cld,grk,mus,gem}.md`, with the consolidated report beside them as `sase_task_system_delegation_layer__final.md`. It's registered as `research:202610/sase_task_system_delegation_layer/sase_task_system_delegation_layer__final.md` (`file:explicit:41beb549033458f6181f781a`). The commit to the research repo is declared and will land when this turn ends.

# New Query

 Generate an infographic that illustrates the main points made in this research markdown
file. Write the image to `<stem>_infographic.png` in the same directory, where
`<stem>` is the source file's stem with any trailing `__final` removed (so
`topic__final.md` becomes `topic_infographic.png`; other stems are unchanged).
Create it without overwrite. If it already exists, stop and report the collision.


The lead researcher's registered report:

{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "markdown" and a.label and a.label.startswith("research:") %}
- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} source_path={{ a.source_path }} path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }}
{% endfor %}

Answer named reader questions with a few validated Mermaid figures for the lead's
research report, writing them to a companion manifest for the swarm linker to place.
The linker is the only publisher: you propose, it places or omits.

## 1. Scope and source

- Never edit the report, never write a report of your own, and create no other file in
  the research checkout (`$(sase repo path research --ensure)`). Keep scratch files in a
  fresh `mktemp -d` directory outside it.
- Read the report once with `sase artifact read` on the registered lead entry listed
  above (its `ref`, or its `research:` label), redirecting the output to a scratch copy.
  Never work from memory or the forked conversation alone.
- If no registered lead report is listed, propose nothing and set `status: failed` with
  that reason (step 8).
- If this prompt also asked for an infographic, finish it first. It is the overview,
  and its panels are candidate hints for your figures, not the frame (step 2).

## 2. Find candidates

The infographic, when this prompt asked for one, comes first: it is the overview.
Its panels are candidate hints, not the frame. Each panel suggests where a reader
question might need a picture, but no figure has to open a panel, and a strong
candidate can come straight from a report section the infographic never touched.

Before deciding anything, write a candidate list in your scratch directory. Cover
each `##` section of the report, and each infographic panel when one exists:

- For each section or panel, name the reader question a picture answers faster than prose.
  Also record the report passages that hold the answer, and the diagram type that fits,
  per the guide's "Choose the type from the content's shape" section. With no
  infographic in this prompt, use each report section that describes a mechanism
  instead.
- Add any mechanism the report explains at length that the infographic left out
  entirely.

Pictures earn their place by showing order, branching, state, ownership, or before
versus after.

## 3. Decide

Judge every candidate, then propose each one that passes, best first, within the cap below.
Zero is right when no reader question survives: zero figures for a survey is a success.
Never reach zero just because the infographic already covers a topic.

A candidate passes when all of these hold:

- it answers a named reader question, and a reader would grasp that answer faster
  from the picture than from the prose;
- it shows order, branching, state, ownership, or before versus after: a flow, a
  state lifecycle, an exchange between actors over time, a dependency structure, a
  phased plan, or a today-versus-proposed pair;
- every box, arrow, and label restates something the report says;
- it does not repeat a Mermaid diagram already in the report, a table, or a short list
  that already shows every step, branch, and condition the diagram would draw. Never turn a table into a diagram.

Reject anything one sentence already explains, short linear chains, refresh or
recompute fan-ins, and repeats of an existing diagram, table, or list.

Rank passing candidates in this order: what the bottom line depends on first, then
today versus proposed, then failure and fallback paths, then drill-downs. Prefer
candidates that answer different reader questions over two views of one question.
When a candidate is too big for one figure, scope it to its most decision-relevant
part, such as the go/no-go rule or the failure path, and scope the caption to that
part. Do not drop the candidate.

Propose at most three diagrams for most reports. A complex report may warrant up to five:
one that explains four or more distinct mechanisms in separate `##` sections, such as an architecture, a protocol, a migration, or a multi-phase plan.
Propose a fourth or fifth diagram only when it passes every test above, answers a reader question no higher-ranked proposal covers, and anchors in a `##` section that holds no other proposal (step 6).
Five is a ceiling, not a target: never lower the bar, split one diagram into two, or add one to reach a count.
A passing candidate the cap leaves out is reported as over the cap (step 8).

## 4. Draw

Draw every diagram by the Mermaid diagram guide below, which governs this step: its
"Make the figure stand alone" section for titles, labels, and edges, its "Fit the PDF
page" section for size, and its "Style with the tested palette" section for colour.
Labels may gloss report terms in plain words but add no facts, and a proposed design
stays marked proposed. Add no actors, steps, numbers, orderings, or causal arrows the
report does not state: trace every box and edge to a sentence in the report.
Conditional wording stays conditional.

## 5. Validate

Put every diagram in a scratch Markdown file with a short paragraph before each one.
Set up the short scratch `TMPDIR`, PDF config, and CLI once by following the guide's
"Render, look, and revise" recipe exactly. Keep the selected CLI and any Puppeteer
flags for every check, record its version, and treat an unavailable smoke render as an
environment failure rather than a bad diagram. Render, look at, and revise each figure
as the guide says: at most two look rounds, then drop the figure.

Run the batch check with the PDF-mirroring config:

```sh
<mmdc> -c <scratch>/pdf.json -i <scratch>/check.md -o <scratch>/check_render.md
```

The check passes only when the command exits 0, its output says
`Found N mermaid charts in Markdown input` for your N, and
`<scratch>/check_render-1.svg` through `-N.svg` all exist. `mmdc` stops at the first
failing diagram and prints `Parse error on line …` with an excerpt. Fix, simplify, or
drop that diagram and rerun; stop after five rounds. These parse-fix rounds are
distinct from the guide's two visual revision rounds.

Measure each `check_render-K.svg` with the guide's measure command. Fail any figure
below 0.75 fit scale: revise it within the look rounds or drop it. If no form is
usable, propose nothing and set `status: failed` with the reason (step 8).

## 6. Anchor

For each kept diagram, choose an `anchor`: 5-20 words copied verbatim from _one line_ of
a body paragraph or list item in the report. Headings, table rows, code blocks, and
existing Mermaid fences never qualify. Confirm `grep -cF -- '<anchor>' <scratch-copy>`
prints `1`; if no unique anchor exists, drop the diagram.
Anchor each figure in the passage whose question it answers, not in the bottom line or
a summary that condenses it.
If a fourth or fifth diagram's anchor shares a `##` section with another proposal's anchor, drop that diagram (step 3).

## 7. Write the manifest

Write `<stem>.diagrams.md` beside the report, without overwrite, where `<stem>` is the
report's stem with any trailing `__final` removed, following the `#research/image` stem
rule (so `topic__final.md` becomes `topic.diagrams.md`). If it already exists, stop
diagram work, register nothing, and set `status: failed` naming the collision (step 8).
Write no file when no diagram survived.

Keep all metadata in the body, never in frontmatter: `sase artifact read` strips YAML
frontmatter. Use no local paths and no `file:` refs; the research repo is public.

````markdown
# Diagram proposals: <report title>

- `source` is the report's `research:` label, `producer` is your agent name, and `check`
  records the CLI version and chart count from the passing run, plus that the
  PDF-mirroring config was used.
- Each `## <id>` is a unique slug of lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens; the linker
  publishes the diagram under the anchor `figure-<id>`. `anchor` is a YAML literal block,
  so backticks and quotes copy exactly. `question` is the reader question the figure
  answers. `illustrates` is one sentence in the report's own terms stating the point
  the diagram makes and what the figure lets a reader see; the linker also builds the figure's in-text reference sentence from it.
  `caption` is the takeaway assertion, at most about 25 words, with no figure number.
  `review` is your audit note: the measured size and fit scale, how the question and look checks went, and the revision rounds;
  the linker never copies `question` or `review` into the report.
- Each `mermaid` fence is byte-identical to the source that passed the check; rerun the
  check after any edit.

## 8. Register and report

- When a manifest exists, register it without `--move`:
  `sase artifact create -p "<abs-path>" -l "diagrams:<YYYYMM>/<name>/<stem>.diagrams.md"`.
  The `diagrams:` label keeps it out of every `research:` listing.
- Then always set the `diagrams` variable, including when you proposed nothing. A missing
  variable means unknown or failed, never "considered and declined". It never carries
  Mermaid bodies. On `ready` and `none`, `considered` is how many candidates
  you judged. `failed` may omit it:

  ```sh
  sase var set diagrams --json --value '{"status": "ready", "count": 2, "considered": 4, "manifest": "<YYYYMM>/<name>/<stem>.diagrams.md", "source_ref": "<lead ref>"}'
  sase var set diagrams --json --value '{"status": "none", "count": 0, "considered": 3, "reason": "Survey of five naming options; no reader question needs a picture."}'
  sase var set diagrams --json --value '{"status": "failed", "count": 0, "reason": "Mermaid CLI (mmdc) unavailable on this host"}'
  ```

- A diagram failure never fails this agent. Finish normally so the linker can publish.
  In the final response, list every candidate with its verdict and its reader question:
  proposed, rejected with a reason, or over the cap. A `none` reason names the candidates considered and why each one
  failed.

The Mermaid diagram guide below governs steps 2–5:

# Mermaid diagram craft

Use these rules to decide whether to draw, choose a diagram type, and check a render.
A figure earns space by making a relationship easier to see than prose.

## Know the one thing the figure says

- Write the reader question first, because a figure without a question has no test of usefulness.
- Write one sentence that answers it, because that becomes the caption.
- Gather source passages for every node and relation, because a tidy picture can still invent a claim.
- Draw when the answer depends on order, branching, state, ownership, or before and after, because those relationships benefit from spatial form.
- Use prose when one sentence answers the question fully, because a diagram should earn its reading time.
- Rank candidates by how much the report's conclusion depends on each answer, because the central reasoning matters more than a detailed side path.
- Keep a candidate list before choosing figures, because comparing alternatives improves selection.
- Let a survey report have zero figures when no reader question needs a picture, because the cap is not a quota.

## Choose the type from the content's shape

- Use `flowchart TD` for a decision or routing rule, because labelled answers show the branches directly.
- Draw decision questions as short hexagons and put each answer on its edge, because the branch meaning stays close to the choice.
- Use `stateDiagram-v2` with `state "Readable name" as ID` for modes or lifecycle, because readable labels should not depend on CamelCase identifiers.
- Use one flowchart subgraph per mode when each mode contains meaningful internal layouts, because grouping makes membership visible.
- Give real mode, owner, and phase subgraphs `fill:none` and a stroke that matches their class, because a transparent boundary groups content without hiding it.
- Use `sequenceDiagram` with at most four participants and `autonumber` for actors over time, because a small cast keeps handoffs trackable.
- Use two subgraphs with reused node names for today's design versus a proposal, because shared names make changed relationships easy to compare.
- Use `flowchart TB` with one subgraph per owner for ownership or layers, because the boundary is part of the claim.
- Use `classDiagram` and `erDiagram` when the source describes real structure, because their notation implies more than a casual association.
- Use `quadrantChart` only when the source itself supplies two axes and item coordinates, because invented coordinates imply unsupported measurements.
- Prefer a list or table when it answers the question, because a picture should add a visible relationship.
- Stay with established flowchart, state, sequence, class, ER, and quadrant families while GitHub's Mermaid version is unverified. Do not use timeline, pie, mindmap, or newer shape syntax, because those families or syntax are outside the tested menu.
- Do not invent structure or add mandatory start and end nodes, because every visible relationship must come from the source.

## Make the figure stand alone

- Treat the figure, its in-figure title, and its caption as one unit, because readers may encounter it away from surrounding paragraphs.
- Add frontmatter `title:` as a question or claim, because the title names the subject at the point of use.
- Add optional invisible `accTitle:` and `accDescr:` frontmatter when they improve screen-reader context, because accessible names can add context without adding visible clutter.
- Quote node labels, because punctuation and reserved words should not change the diagram grammar.
- Make labels a bold name plus a short gloss in a backtick Markdown string, because the name scans quickly and the gloss supplies context.
- Aim for eight words or fewer per node label, because long labels enlarge the diagram.
- Keep decision questions to about five words, because compact questions fit hexagons cleanly.
- Avoid `end` as a node ID, because Mermaid treats it as syntax in some flowcharts.
- Label every non-obvious edge with a verb or condition, because an unlabelled arrow can mean order, dependency, or data flow.
- Use one arrow meaning throughout and state whether converging arrows mean “all” or “any”, because readers need a consistent way to follow the logic.
- Expand abbreviations and project terms in a label or caption, because the diagram should not require insider knowledge.
- Give the caption the one-sentence takeaway, because the title names the subject while the caption states what the reader should learn.
- Mark proposed, optional, and failure paths in words and with a compatible line style, because colour or shape alone may not carry the distinction.
- Name only entities and relationships supported by source passages, because visual structure can make an inference look like a fact.
- Keep each box useful to the reader's question, because empty chooser and sink nodes add steps without adding meaning.

## Fit the PDF page

- Aim for a natural SVG size near 650 × 700 px, because that leaves room around a figure at full size.
- Keep the fit scale at or above 75%, because smaller labels become hard to read in the Highlights PDF.
- Measure the root SVG and calculate `min(1, 652.8 / width, 892.8 / height)`, because the PDF fits a 652.8 × 892.8 px text box.
- Tighten `flowchart.rankSpacing`, `flowchart.nodeSpacing`, and optionally `wrappingWidth: 260` before removing supported content, because spacing can improve fit without losing the claim.
- Keep decision text short, because long text inside a hexagon or diamond wraps at the 200 px default and makes the shape grow quickly.
- Split two distinct reader questions into two figures rather than shrinking labels, because readable type matters more than a one-page count.
- Try Mermaid's default layout first and `layout: dagre` when routing adds awkward jogs, because neither layout is best for every graph.

Use the Python measurement command at the end of the render recipe on each SVG. It
reads only root width and height, falls back to the root `viewBox` when either is
missing or nonnumeric, rejects unusable dimensions, and exits unsuccessfully below the
75% floor.

## Style with the tested palette

- Use `classDef`, `class`, and `style` for fills, strokes, and text colour, because those are honored by the research PDF render.
- Choose no more than three semantic colour classes in one figure, because a small palette keeps colour meaningful.
- Copy these fixed fill / stroke / text triples, because they were checked with the PDF theme and remain legible in light and dark GitHub themes.

```text
classDef focus fill:#E8F1FB,stroke:#3B78C2,stroke-width:1.5px,color:#0F2E52
classDef decision fill:#FFF7E6,stroke:#C77C02,stroke-width:1.5px,color:#4A3000
classDef outcome fill:#E7F5EC,stroke:#2E7D4F,stroke-width:1.5px,color:#123D24
classDef risk fill:#FDECEC,stroke:#C0392B,stroke-width:1.5px,color:#5F1414
classDef muted fill:#F3F4F6,stroke:#6B7280,stroke-width:1.5px,color:#1F2937
classDef proposed stroke-dasharray:5 3
```

For a proposed node that also has a palette role, give it both classes on separate
lines:

```text
class NODE muted
class NODE proposed
```

- Apply at most three semantic colour classes per figure, because unused hues weaken the meaning of the palette.
- Stack a palette class and `proposed` with two `class` lines, because comma-separated classes silently apply nothing and chained `:::` classes do not parse.
- Use `-.->` for proposed or optional paths and at most one `==>` for the main path, because line weight should reinforce reading order.
- Let labels and line styles carry essential meaning as well as colour, because readers should not have to distinguish hues alone.
- Use `<br/>` for a deliberate line break and backtick Markdown labels for bold names, because both render correctly in the strict PDF configuration.
- Keep theme directives, `click`, icons, emoji, and index-based `linkStyle` out of figures, because the PDF locks theme settings and edge indices can shift with subgraphs.
- Use plain HTML-free labels apart from `<br/>`, because strict rendering sanitizes other markup.

## Render, look, and revise

- Render SVG and PNG with the PDF-mirroring configuration below, because Mermaid defaults can differ from the document readers see.
- Use a short scratch path as `TMPDIR`, because browser socket paths can exceed platform limits.
- Select and smoke-test the CLI once, then keep the successful command and flags, because switching renderers mid-review changes the evidence.
- Record the selected Mermaid CLI version, because the renderer affects output.
- Render both formats with the same PDF config, because the image being reviewed must match the measured SVG.
- Treat a browser-start failure as an environment failure, because it says nothing about diagram quality.
- Open the PNG and answer the reader question from the image alone. Check labels, arrowheads, crossings, reading direction, and measured fit, then trace every entity and relation to a source passage.
- If the runtime cannot view images, disclose that limit and rely on measured dimensions and source checks, because parsing alone does not prove visual quality.
- Revise at most twice and then drop a figure that still fails, because extra rounds often polish a picture that should not be there.
- Bound PNG export and retry once only after a Puppeteer connection failure, because that export can stall without a diagram defect.

Run this recipe from a directory containing `figure.mmd`. It writes the PDF-mirroring
config inline, tries the pinned CLI before a global install, and retries a browser
sandbox-start failure once with Puppeteer's no-sandbox flag. If neither CLI form works,
record an environment failure and do not judge the diagram.

The secure list, neutral theme, DejaVu Sans font, and `useMaxWidth: false` options mirror
the Highlights renderer. A frontmatter theme override should remain neutral under this
config. A deliberately broken diagram must still make the chosen CLI exit nonzero.

The raw block keeps Mermaid's double-brace hexagon intact through Jinja expansion.

## Worked examples

Each source below was rendered with the recipe above. The SVG links show the rendered
result; the measured dimensions and fit scale make each example checkable.

### Route a documentation change

**Reader question:** Where should a documentation change live?

**Source statement:** Behavior changes go to Reference; new capabilities get a Reference
entry and a guide candidate; design choices get a decision record; internals and runbooks
belong in Contribute.

**Caption:** Route documentation by the kind of change so user behavior, design choices,
and implementation guidance each have a clear home.

### Show automatic and locked layouts

**Reader question:** What changes when a layout is locked?

**Source statement:** Automatic mode switches from spread to paged above 1.65 screens;
P can choose a wider layout and lock it; the palette returns either locked layout to
automatic mode. A proposed toggle would hold the automatic layout currently selected.

**Caption:** Automatic mode follows content height; P can lock a wider layout, and the
palette returns either locked layout to automatic mode. The proposed toggle would hold
whichever automatic layout is selected.

## Response

I’ll read the registered report and create the infographic first, then assess which additional diagrams would help readers. I’m using the SASE artifact and repository skills, plus the image-generation and Mermaid skills.


The report centers on one loop: authorize work, run it, return evidence, and review it in the task system. I’ll make that the infographic’s focus, alongside the use cases and three design constraints: explicit trigger tags, Bob-owned write-back, and answers outside the Highlights-generated block.


The infographic is generated and visually checked. The report already has lifecycle and write-ownership diagrams; I’m checking the remaining candidates for relationships those figures don’t cover. Your criteria allow zero additions when the existing diagrams, tables, or lists already answer the reader questions.


The infographic is saved and registered. I assessed 16 diagram candidates across every report section and infographic panel. None passed the duplication test: the existing figures, tables, or short lists already show their relationships. I’ve recorded `diagrams.status = none` for the linker; no diagram manifest was created. I’m now submitting the required SASE final declaration for the image.


Created [sase_task_system_delegation_layer_infographic.png](/home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/sase-org/sase/sase_10/sase/repos/research/202610/sase_task_system_delegation_layer/sase_task_system_delegation_layer_infographic.png) without overwrite. The 1024×1536 PNG was visually checked and registered as `file:explicit:6f67d7a36be02d245a8560c7`.

Used the built-in image generator with this [prompt](/tmp/research-visuals.h45Auf/infographic-prompt.txt). The report remains unchanged.

**Diagram assessment:** 16 candidates considered; none proposed. Recorded `diagrams.status = none`; no manifest created.

| Candidate reader question | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Who authorizes work and settles it? | Rejected: existing lifecycle figure. |
| How do commitments, delegations, and attempts relate? | Rejected: one sentence suffices. |
| What exists today versus what needs building? | Rejected: capability tables already answer it. |
| How should tags, Pending, and Highlights answers work? | Rejected: verdict table already answers it. |
| When may returned evidence set Pending? | Rejected: existing digest-match rule states both branches. |
| Does clarification approval authorize execution? | Rejected: three gate choices already show the branches. |
| How do annotation answers survive sync? | Rejected: numbered workflow already explains it. |
| What use cases extend beyond implementation? | Rejected: a catalog already presented as a table. |
| What can adapters write without conditional writes? | Rejected: one sentence suffices. |
| Who writes the task? | Rejected: existing sequence figure. |
| How does failed publication recover? | Rejected: reliability table already specifies recovery. |
| Where may private content go? | Rejected: short rules suffice; a decision tree would invent ordering. |
| How should capabilities roll out? | Rejected: existing phase list shows the sequence. |
| When should launches pause or retreat? | Rejected: concise rules already state the conditions. |
| Which choices remain human decisions? | Rejected: question list has no diagrammable dependencies. |
| Which evidence supports the conclusions? | Rejected: source inventory needs no additional figure. |

SASE accepted the final declaration for the infographic.
