You are the linker agent for a research swarm. The lead researcher,
`research.4f.final`, has written a consolidated report on the request below. Your job
is to publish that report as the canonical `<name>.md`: the file readers open, and the
one SASE renders into a Highlights PDF. You are an editor, not a researcher. The new
file must carry exactly the lead's meaning and intent. Do not do research of your own:
add no new claims or sources, settle no open questions, and neither soften nor
strengthen the conclusions or the recommendation. If the lead seems wrong, leave it as
written. The only prose you write yourself is the short research-query summary of the
request that opens the file (step 3).

SASE derives your plan's links from the artifacts you read this turn; use
`sase artifact read` for context you actually used.

Research request (context only; do not research it, but summarize it as the file's
research query in step 3):

I
am thinking about implementing some form of evals for sase.

- See the related research files (I think one of the Databricks research files were the
  ones to first suggest this) in the research sidecar repo and in the private
  bbugyi200/job--research GitHub repo for context.
- I think I am going to implement evals using goals somehow, which do not exist yet
  (review recent related research--note that I've done some thrashing on the
  requirements for this one, so favor more recent research files related to goals).
- Also, see my annotations in the
  ~/bob/ref/papers/2026_goals_as_first_class_abstractions_in_human_ai_collaboration_automationxp26.md
  file (and the corresponding research file) for some ideas (that I mostly agree with)
  on what goals should be.

I'm new to evals and am still thinking through goals. Can you do some research with the
goal of finding some articles or papers that inspire me / help me think through all of
this? End your analysis with a ranked list of articles/papers that you think I should
consider reading.

The lead researcher's registered report:

{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "markdown" and a.label and a.label.startswith("research:") %}
- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} source_path={{ a.source_path }} path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }}
{% endfor %}

The image agent's registered images:

{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "image" %}
- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} vcs_relpath={{ a.vcs_relpath }} path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }}
{% endfor %}


Steps:

1. **Identify the source.** From the registered reports above, find exactly one entry
   with `wait_name` `research.4f.final` whose label has the form
   `research:<YYYYMM>/<name>/<name>__final.md`. If there is not exactly one such entry,
   stop and report the missing or ambiguous input instead of guessing. Open the research
   repo with `/sase_repo`, then read the report through its canonical research reference
   (or the `ref` field's `file:<id>` reference if the original has moved) using
   `sase artifact read`. Take `<YYYYMM>/<name>/` from the label, never from the current
   date. Do not read predecessor chat transcripts. Never modify, move, or delete
   `<name>__final.md` or the drafts.

2. **Inventory what must survive.** Before writing, list every finding, recommendation,
   caveat, open question, confidence statement, number, date, version, code block,
   table, and link in the lead's report.
3. **Restructure** the lead's report into a well-thought-out organization:
   - Keep the frontmatter, updating `updated_time` if present.
   - **Open the file in this exact order**, with nothing else between these parts: the frontmatter (if any), one `#` title, the research query, the infographic, and then the bottom-line section.
   - **Research query.** Directly below the title, add one blockquote that summarizes
     the research request above in one to three sentences, for example
     `> **Research query:** <summary>`. Phrase it as the question or task being
     answered, in the requester's own terms: keep the questions, named subjects, and
     explicit scope or constraints; drop instructions aimed at agents, such as output
     paths, macro or directive syntax, and formatting requests. Summarize what was
     asked, not material the request quotes or attaches. Use a request that is already
     one short sentence verbatim. Never fold findings, answers, or scope the request
     does not state into it. It is not a heading, so it gets no section number and no
     TOC entry.
   - **Embed the infographic** exactly once, directly above the bottom-line section:
     after the research query and before that section's `##` heading, never further
     down. Use a relative link with descriptive alt text, for example
     `![<alt text>](<name>_infographic.png)`. Locate it by the
     `<name>_infographic.png` convention or the image entries above. Embed only a file
     you have confirmed exists beside the report in your research checkout. If the
     image agent completed without producing one, publish without it (the research query then sits directly above the bottom-line section) and say so in the final
     response.
   - **Bottom-line section.** The first `##` section is `## Bottom line` (or
     `## Overview` when the report surveys options rather than giving one answer) and
     gives the answer first.
   - Below it, `##` and `###` sections ordered by the questions a reader will ask, with
     duplicated passages merged.
   - **Never number headings.** The PDF renderer runs pandoc with `--number-sections`,
     so hand-numbered headings render doubly numbered.
   - **No table of contents and no block of jump links.** The PDF already gets a TOC.
   - Keep the lead's wording where it works. Never drop a claim, caveat, or source to
     save space. If the lead's report restates the question or lists its inputs, keep
     those details in a later section; the research query summarizes the request but
     does not replace them.
4. **Validate every link carried over.**
   - Relative links resolve from `<YYYYMM>/<name>/`, and in-document anchors resolve
     against the final headings. Both are hard requirements.
   - Check external URLs with `curl -fsSL -o /dev/null --max-time 20 <url>`, retrying
     a transient failure once. Treat 401, 403, 429, and timeouts as _unverified_ and
     keep those links.
   - Verify repository-file links through a `/sase_repo` checkout, not by fetching
     github.com.
   - Repair a link only when the right target is certain: a followed redirect, a moved
     file, an obvious typo, or a renamed heading. For an unrepairable link, keep its
     text, drop the dead URL, and list it in the final response. **Never search for a
     replacement source.**

5. **Add in-document links** so readers can jump between parts of the file. Add them
   inline and sparingly: from summary points to the sections that back them, from "see
   above" or "see below" phrases, and from mentions of a named option, phase, or
   finding to where it is discussed. Do not link every mention.
   - Every heading used as a link target must start with a letter, contain only
     letters, digits, spaces, and hyphens, and be unique. Its anchor is then the
     lowercased heading with spaces replaced by hyphens, for example
     `[the bottom line](#bottom-line)`. pandoc (the PDF) and GitHub then agree.
   - Move emoji, version numbers, and code out of such headings, into the section's
     first line.
   - When `pandoc` is available, confirm anchors with `pandoc <file> -t html`.

6. **Re-check against the step-2 inventory** and restore anything missing or changed.
   Every URL in `<name>__final.md` must appear in the new file unless it was listed as
   unrepairable. Then confirm the file opens in the step-3 order: title, research query, infographic, bottom-line section.

7. **Write** `<YYYYMM>/<name>/<name>.md` without overwrite. On a collision, stop and
   report it.

8. **Register** it as a durable snapshot:

   sase artifact create -p "<absolute-report-path>" -l "research:<repo-relative-report-path>"

   Use the report's actual absolute path and its path relative to the research repo
   root, for example `research:202609/<name>/<name>.md`. Use no `--move`. If
   registration fails, report it and do not claim full completion.

## Response

I've opened the research repo and read the lead's final report. Next I'll go through it to list everything that has to carry over.

The infographic exists and the report contains 52 unique URLs. I'm checking each URL now.

Draft written. Now validating URLs, anchors, relative links, and numbers against the source.

Numbers all match; the only differences come from removed heading numbers, link-text tokenization, and my query/alt text. Now a word-level diff to confirm no prose was dropped.

The diff shows only the intended moves and heading edits. Next I'll confirm the moved blocks match the source word for word.

All checks pass: no URLs, numbers, or prose missing, all 26 anchors resolve, and the file opens in the required order. Writing the file into the research checkout, refusing to overwrite.

Registration succeeded. Now submitting the final declaration.

I've published the lead's report as `202610/evals_through_goals_reading_list/evals_through_goals_reading_list.md` and registered it as `file:explicit:f04aa8f846e30063392bea6f`. It will be committed to the research repo after this turn ends. I didn't modify or move `__final.md` or the drafts.

**How the file opens:** the title, then a two-sentence research query I wrote from your request, then the infographic (it exists beside the report), then `## Bottom line`.

**Order of the rest:**
1. Where things stand
2. A mental model to read with
3. Tensions and what the evidence says
4. A first experiment the readings point to
5. Ranked reading list: Tiers A–C, honorable mentions, the not-re-ranked picks, and the suggested `bob ref create` commands
6. Corrections to the researcher reports
7. Method and limits

The one move I made on my own judgment: the lead put Corrections before the ranked list, and I moved it after. Corrections and Method are about where the claims came from, and your request asked for the analysis to end with the ranked list.

**Editing changes (no claims added or dropped):**
- **Section numbers removed** from headings, since the PDF renderer numbers sections itself.
- **Reading-list ranks moved** out of the headings into a **Rank #N.** line under each one.
- **Headings simplified** so their anchors work in both the PDF and GitHub, e.g. "Who Validates the Validators" without the "?" and "Hard to Eval Is a Product Smell". Where a heading lost the exact title, I added a **Title.** line with it.
- **"§4" and "§5" references** became links to the named sections.
- **Every other in-document link** was updated to the new headings, and I added a few sparingly.
- **The lead's own longer restatement of the request** and the "Lead synthesis" line linking the five researcher reports are kept under Method and limits.

**Checks:**
- **URLs:** all 52 URLs from the lead's report are in the new file, and nothing new was added. Every one returned 200 except the OpenAI post (`openai.com/index/why-we-no-longer-evaluate-swe-bench-verified/`), which returned 403. I've kept that one as unverified. Three URLs redirect only trivially (Harbor, the DeepMind post, the METR post), so I kept the original URLs. No link was unrepairable.
- **Other links:** all 26 in-document links resolve in pandoc's HTML output, and the relative links to the five researcher reports and the image resolve.
- **Content:** a word-level diff and a numbers comparison against the source show only the intended structural edits. The Corrections table and the Method section match the source word for word.
