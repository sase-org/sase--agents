You are the linker agent for a research swarm. The lead researcher,
`research.2h.final`, has written a consolidated report on the request below. Your job
is to publish that report as the canonical `<name>.md`: the file readers open, and the
one SASE renders into a Highlights PDF. You are an editor, not a researcher. The new
file must carry exactly the lead's meaning and intent. Do not do research of your own:
add no new claims or sources, settle no open questions, and neither soften nor
strengthen the conclusions or the recommendation. If the lead seems wrong, leave it as
written. The only prose you write yourself is the short research-query summary of the
request that opens the file (step 3). The only other content you
add is the image agent's diagrams and captions, copied verbatim, plus a figure anchor
and one short reference sentence for each diagram you place (step 3).

SASE derives your plan's links from the artifacts you read this turn; use
`sase artifact read` for context you actually used.

Research request (context only; do not research it, but summarize it as the file's
research query in step 3):

I've been thinking about how sase integrates with my task managment system (see the
bob-cli project and related GitHub repos in the bobs-org organization for more context)
currently and I think I have myself convinced that there is a deeper connection between
sase (and agent orchestration in general) and task management systems. I am at the very
beginning stages of thinking about this / designing this integration. Can you do some
research with the goal of helping me determine if this is a good idea and, if so, what
types of use-cases would be unlocked by a deeper, task-management system agnostic sase
integration? Some notes related to other use-cases I've been considering for this
functionality can be found below:

- It would be useful to be able to tag an Obsidian task as ready to be worked and have a
  sase agent automatically launched at some point to work it. Evidence of completion
  could then be added to that Obsidian task by the integration and the task would be
  marked as pending (i.e. `[/]`).
- For tasks that I have not tagged to be worked on by sase agents but for which agents
  are confident they understand, it would be useful if an agent could propose
  adjustments to that task to further clarify the requirements. If accepted this would
  then add the appropriate tag, which automatically triggers a sase agent launch. This
  sase launch proposal might correspond with a prompt that asks an agent to plan out and
  implement the work or it could be, for example, a research swarm proposal (using the
  `#research_swarm` macro swarm).
- I sometimes leave questions about a reference PDF I am reading in the Highlights app
  via a note on a highlight which gets saved to a markdown file in the ~/bob/ref/
  directory. It would be useful for agents to be able to answer those questions
  automatically (maybe when tagged with `#q`?) and then write those answers to the same
  note that asked the question.
- These are just a few things that I have thought up off the top of my head. You should
  think hard about what others might exist.

The lead researcher's registered report:

{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "markdown" and a.label and a.label.startswith("research:") %}
- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} source_path={{ a.source_path }} path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }}
{% endfor %}

The image agent's registered images:

{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "image" %}
- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} vcs_relpath={{ a.vcs_relpath }} path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }}
{% endfor %}


The image agent's diagram proposals:

{% if agents is defined %}{% for key, outputs in agents.items() if outputs.diagrams is defined %}
- agent={{ key }} diagrams={{ outputs.diagrams }}
{% endfor %}{% endif %}
{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.label and a.label.startswith("diagrams:") %}
- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }}
{% endfor %}


Steps:

1. **Identify the source.** From the registered reports above, find exactly one entry
   with `wait_name` `research.2h.final` whose label has the form
   `research:<YYYYMM>/<name>/<name>__final.md`. If there is not exactly one such entry,
   stop and report the missing or ambiguous input instead of guessing. Open the research
   repo with `/sase_repo`, then read the report through its canonical research reference
   (or the `ref` field's `file:<id>` reference if the original has moved) using
   `sase artifact read`. Take `<YYYYMM>/<name>/` from the label, never from the current
   date. Do not read predecessor chat transcripts. Never modify, move, or delete
   `<name>__final.md` or the drafts or `<name>.diagrams.md`.
   Read the `diagrams` variable of `research.2h.image`. Only when its `status` is
   `ready`, take exactly one listed `diagrams:` entry from `wait_name`
   `research.2h.image` whose label is
   `diagrams:<YYYYMM>/<name>/<name>.diagrams.md` for the lead's own
   `<YYYYMM>/<name>/`. Read it with `sase artifact read`, and confirm its `source`
   equals the lead's label. Publish with no proposed diagrams, and say why in the
   final response, if the status is `none` or `failed`, the variable is missing, the
   manifest entry is missing or ambiguous, or the source does not match. Diagram
   problems never stop publication. The manifest's `question` and `review` are the
   image agent's audit notes: never copy them into the report.

2. **Inventory what must survive.** Before writing, list every finding, recommendation,
   caveat, open question, confidence statement, number, date, version, code block,
   table (record its cells; step 3 converts each one into a list), and link in the
   lead's report. For each manifest diagram, record its ID against
   the one lead block (paragraph or list item) that contains its `anchor`. Mark a
   diagram whose anchor matches zero or several blocks as omitted. Mark every diagram after the fifth in manifest order as omitted (over the cap).
3. **Restructure** the lead's report into a well-thought-out organization:
   - Keep the frontmatter, updating `updated_time` if present.
   - **Open the file in this exact order**, with nothing else between these parts: the frontmatter (if any), one `#` title, the research query, the infographic, and then the bottom-line section.
   - **Research query.** Directly below the title, add one blockquote that summarizes
     the research request above in one to three sentences, for example
     `> **Research query:** <summary>`. Phrase it as the question or task being
     answered, in the requester's own terms: keep the questions, named subjects, and
     explicit scope or constraints; drop instructions aimed at agents, such as output
     paths, macro or directive syntax, and formatting requests. Summarize what was
     asked, not material the request quotes or attaches. Use a request that is already
     one short sentence verbatim. Never fold findings, answers, or scope the request
     does not state into it. It is not a heading, so it gets no section number and no
     TOC entry.
   - **Embed the infographic** exactly once, directly above the bottom-line section:
     after the research query and before that section's `##` heading, never further
     down. Use a relative link with descriptive alt text, for example
     `![<alt text>](<name>_infographic.png)`. Locate it by the
     `<name>_infographic.png` convention or the image entries above. Embed only a file
     you have confirmed exists beside the report in your research checkout. If the
     image agent completed without producing one, publish without it (the research query then sits directly above the bottom-line section) and say so in the final
     response.
   - **Bottom-line section.** The first `##` section is `## Bottom line` (or
     `## Overview` when the report surveys options rather than giving one answer) and
     gives the answer first.
   - Below it, `##` and `###` sections ordered by the questions a reader will ask, with
     duplicated passages merged.
   - **Never number headings.** The PDF renderer runs pandoc with `--number-sections`,
     so hand-numbered headings render doubly numbered.
   - **No table of contents and no block of jump links.** The PDF already gets a TOC.
   - **No tables.** The PDF renderer (pandoc → XeLaTeX) prints tables with equal-width
     columns, cramped wrapped cells, and rows that jump pages. Convert every table in the
     lead's report (pipe, grid, simple, multiline, or HTML) into a list with one item per
     row, keeping every cell's content:
     - Two columns: `- **<first cell>:** <second cell>`.
     - Three or more columns: a bullet whose first line is the row's identifying cell in
       bold (merge an ID column into it, e.g. `- **A1. Restart exactly once**`), then one
       nested bullet per remaining non-empty cell, `- *<Column header>:* <cell>`, in column
       order. Labels go in italics so bold inside a value stays distinct.
     - Ordered rows (phases, steps, ranks, tiers): the same shapes as a numbered list,
       keeping the original numbers.
     - Grouped rows (a blank first cell continues the group above): nest them under one
       bullet for the group.
     - Rows whose cells are all a few words: one line,
       `- **<row>:** <header> <value> · <header> <value> · …`.
     - Numbers: keep units, periods, denominators, and the difference between zero,
       unknown, and not applicable.
     - Long code in a cell: a fenced code block inside the list item.
     - Only when the rows are about six or fewer major named options the report discusses
       at length: one `###` section per option holding the same italic-labelled bullets.
       Never turn a row into a `####` heading. Turn a table caption into a one-line lead-in
       sentence. Put a blank line before every list (pandoc otherwise merges it into the
       paragraph above). Indent nested bullets 2 spaces under `- ` and
       3 spaces under `1. `. Write URLs as `[text](url)` or `<url>`, never bare. Do not
       substitute a definition list (`Term` then `: definition`), an HTML table, a grid
       or simple table, a table in a code block, a callout or `:::` div, raw LaTeX, or
       an image, or a diagram. Never drop a cell, merge two rows, or add totals, rankings, or
       conclusions the table did not state.
   - Keep the lead's wording where it works. Never drop a claim, caveat, or source to
     save space. If the lead's report restates the question or lists its inputs, keep
     those details in a later section; the research query summarizes the request but
     does not replace them.
   - **Place proposed diagrams.** After restructuring, insert each fence byte-for-byte
     directly after the block that now carries the tagged content, even if that content
     was reordered, merged, or converted from a table into a list. Only that figure's
     reference sentence may sit between the block and its fence. Follow the fence with
     the caption as one italic line, with blank lines around both, and wrap the fence
     and caption in the figure anchor described below. Then check that the surrounding
     final text still states the `illustrates` point and that no box or edge contradicts
     it. Omit the diagram otherwise. Never place a diagram in the fixed opening
     sequence, directly under a heading, inside a list or blockquote (put it after the
     whole list), or in an appendix; bottom-line content goes at the end of that
     section; two diagrams on one block go in manifest order. Never edit, redraw,
     merge, or invent a diagram. A private scratch marker such as `<!-- D:<id> -->` may
     be used in the working draft but must be gone before writing.
   - **Anchor every placed figure.** Wrap each placed fence and its caption, and
     nothing else, in `<div id="figure-<id>">` and `</div>`, using its manifest `## <id>`.
     Convert the ID to lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens, replacing each run of
     other characters with one hyphen. Keep the resulting ID unique in the file; if it
     matches a heading anchor or another figure ID, append `-2`, `-3`, and so on. Leave
     a blank line after the opening tag and before the closing tag so GitHub and pandoc
     parse the fence and caption as Markdown. The wrapper is the figure's link target
     on both reading surfaces: GitHub keeps its ID for jumps, and the Highlights PDF
     gives it return links. Use this shape:

     ````markdown
     <div id="figure-publication-order">

     <the manifest's mermaid fence, byte-for-byte>

     _The linker publishes once, after every companion finishes._

     </div>
     ````

     Never put an ID or attribute on the fence itself, and never substitute an `<a>`
     anchor or a heading. This wrapper and the listen card are the only HTML blocks you
     write. The table rule that forbids `:::` divs is about table substitutes and does
     not cover this figure wrapper.
   - **Reference every placed figure.** Write exactly one short sentence per placed
     figure and link it with `[<link text>](#figure-<id>)`, using the final unique ID,
     so every published figure is referenced. Tell the reader what the figure makes
     visible that the prose alone does not, such as a path, order, branch, or handoff.
     Build the sentence from the manifest's `illustrates` point, phrased in the
     surrounding text's terms. Never write a bare pointer such as "See the diagram below."
     The sentence is a pointer, not a finding: add no claim, number, actor,
     step, or causal link that `illustrates` and the surrounding final text do not
     already state; keep conditional wording conditional and proposed designs distinct
     from implemented ones. Do not repeat the caption word for word. Name the figure in
     the link text, for example `the publication-order diagram`.
     Never use "here", "this", or a figure number in the link text. Keep it to about
     12 to 30 words of plain prose. It is
     not italic, a heading, or a list item, and never goes inside the figure's `<div>`,
     its caption, or a blockquote. When the figure directly follows the paragraph that
     carries its anchor, make the reference sentence end that paragraph. Otherwise,
     give it its own short paragraph directly above the figure's `<div>`; this happens
     when the anchor sits in a list (so the figure follows the whole list) or when the
     figure closes the bottom-line section. Two figures after one block get one sentence
     each, in manifest order. If you omit a figure, delete its sentence too; no link may
     point to an unpublished figure. For example: `… so the link must be in the linker's first commit. [The publication-order diagram](#figure-publication-order) traces why the linker waits for every companion agent: the PDF hook fires only once, on the ADD of name.md.`
4. **Validate every link carried over.**
   - Relative links resolve from `<YYYYMM>/<name>/`, and in-document anchors resolve
     against the final headings and figure anchors. Both are hard requirements.
   - Check external URLs with `curl -fsSL -o /dev/null --max-time 20 <url>`, retrying
     a transient failure once. Treat 401, 403, 429, and timeouts as _unverified_ and
     keep those links.
   - Verify repository-file links through a `/sase_repo` checkout, not by fetching
     github.com.
   - Repair a link only when the right target is certain: a followed redirect, a moved
     file, an obvious typo, or a renamed heading. For an unrepairable link, keep its
     text, drop the dead URL, and list it in the final response. **Never search for a
     replacement source.**

5. **Add in-document links** so readers can jump between parts of the file. Add them
   inline and sparingly: from summary points to the sections that back them, from "see
   above" or "see below" phrases, and from mentions of a named option, phase, or
   finding to where it is discussed. Do not link every mention.
   - Every heading used as a link target must start with a letter, contain only
     letters, digits, spaces, and hyphens, and be unique. Its anchor is then the
     lowercased heading with spaces replaced by hyphens, for example
     `[the bottom line](#bottom-line)`. pandoc (the PDF) and GitHub then agree.
   - Move emoji, version numbers, and code out of such headings, into the section's
     first line.
   - When `pandoc` is available, confirm anchors with `pandoc <file> -t html`.
   - A summary point that discusses a figure's content may also link sparingly to its
     `figure-<id>` anchor. Always link a figure through that anchor, never through a
     nearby heading.

6. **Re-check against the step-2 inventory** and restore anything missing or changed.
   Every URL in `<name>__final.md` must appear in the new file unless it was listed as
   unrepairable. Then confirm the file opens in the step-3 order: title, research query, infographic, bottom-line section.
   Confirm every cell of every table in the lead's report appears in the new file. When
   `pandoc` is available, confirm no table survives:
   `pandoc <file> -f markdown -t json | grep -o -i -E '"t":"Table"|"t":"RawBlock","c":\["html","<table' | wc -l`
   prints `0`. Every Mermaid diagram from the lead's report is still present. Every manifest diagram appears exactly once, byte-identical,
   or is named as omitted. Every accepted diagram sits inside exactly one figure-anchor
   `<div>` holding only its fence and caption, and its reference sentence links to it:
   `grep -c '^<div id="figure-' <file>` equals the number of accepted diagrams; every
   `(#figure-` link names an ID that exists in the file; and `pandoc <file> -t html`
   shows each `id="figure-<id>"`. The published mermaid fence count equals the
   lead's count plus the number of accepted proposed diagrams. In the final response, list accepted diagram IDs with their
   `figure-<id>` anchors and omitted IDs with reasons. Never write "diagrams pending".

7. **Write** `<YYYYMM>/<name>/<name>.md` without overwrite. On a collision, stop and
   report it.

8. **Register** it as a durable snapshot:

   sase artifact create -p "<absolute-report-path>" -l "research:<repo-relative-report-path>"

   Use the report's actual absolute path and its path relative to the research repo
   root, for example `research:202609/<name>/<name>.md`. Use no `--move`. If
   registration fails, report it and do not claim full completion.

## Response

Opened the research repo and read the lead's report. Next I'll go through its contents before restructuring it.

Checking the infographic so I can write accurate alt text, then I'll write the restructured report.

Tables are converted to lists. Now running the restructure script, then checking links and anchors.

The report is published and registered. Now submitting the final declaration so the host commits the new file.

I published the lead's report as the canonical `202610/sase_task_system_delegation_layer/sase_task_system_delegation_layer.md` and registered it as `research:202610/sase_task_system_delegation_layer/sase_task_system_delegation_layer.md` (`file:explicit:a4b15608807ba88de276ff05`). The host will commit it to the research repo after this turn ends. I didn't change `__final.md` or the drafts.

**Opening order:** the file opens with the title, then the research query, the infographic (`sase_task_system_delegation_layer_infographic.png`, confirmed beside the report), and `## Bottom line`. Nothing else sits between them.

**What changed:**
- **Headings:** I removed the hand numbering. Headings that are link targets now hold only letters, digits, spaces and hyphens. The code in two headings (`[/]` and `#q`) moved into an italic first line under the heading.
- **Section order:** the two use-case sections now come right after "Is the connection real", ahead of "What already exists and what is missing". That puts the request's second question (which use cases this unlocks) earlier. The other sections keep the lead's order, with Provenance last.
- **Lead's intro note:** its italic method note (five reports merged, public repo, nothing in the vault changed) now opens the Provenance section, because nothing may sit between the title and the bottom line.
- **Tables:** all 13 are now lists. A script checked that every cell survives, except column headers that the list formats drop by design. The "(illustrative)" qualifier on the tag table's header became "Tags are illustrative:". `pandoc` finds 0 tables in the new file.
- **Cross-references:** every §-number reference is now an in-document link, and "row N" references to the verdicts are now "item N". I also added eight links from Bottom line points to the sections behind them. Every anchor resolves in `pandoc -t html`.
- **Content:** the lead's wording, numbers, caveats and open questions are otherwise unchanged. Both Mermaid diagrams and the YAML block are byte-identical (2 Mermaid fences, the same count as the lead's).

**Links:** all 10 external URLs returned 200 with no redirects, and all of them are still in the file. There were no repository-file or other relative links to check besides the infographic. None were unrepairable.

**Proposed diagrams:** none placed. The image agent reported `status: none` (16 considered, 0 proposed), and there is no `.diagrams.md` file, so the file has no `figure-` anchors.
