%clan(research.28, tribe=research, summary=[[[bold]RESEARCH PROMPT:[/bold] We recently implemented the
`sase tool` command, which is just the first part of a larger plan (see the
sase_tool_epic_roadmap.md file in the research sidecar repo and the sase-135 epic bead
for context). I'm thinking about taking the next steps on this. Here's what I'm thinking
that those next steps should be:

- Add support for smoe way of enforcing that sase agents always use the `sase tool`
  command for certain commands. I want you to lead the design on this one, but one
  possible solution would be to implement a new `sase tool ensure-not-agent` command
  that commands (like the `just check` command, for example) could call at the start of
  their logic. This command could then fail if it detects a sase agent. Whatever
  solution we go with, make sure that sase agents are able to override this somehow (in
  case, for example, the `sase tool` command is broken).
- We should start making sase monitors wrap the command they run with the `sase tool`
  command. This should be possible since the `sase tool` command should be able to run
  any arbitrary command (you might need to implement this).

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a
different approach? Make any adjustments to the requirements that you think are
justified but clearly call these out. End your analysis with a recommended solution.]]) %id:research.28.final %m:@xlarge

You are the lead researcher: 3 independent researchers have reported on the request
below, and you will add your own research and merge every perspective into one
consolidated report.

SASE derives your plan's links from the artifacts you read this turn; use
`sase artifact read` for context you actually used.

Research request:

We recently implemented the
`sase tool` command, which is just the first part of a larger plan (see the
sase_tool_epic_roadmap.md file in the research sidecar repo and the sase-135 epic bead
for context). I'm thinking about taking the next steps on this. Here's what I'm thinking

The researchers' registered reports:

{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "markdown" and a.label and a.label.startswith("research:") %}
- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} source_path={{ a.source_path }} path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }}
{% endfor %}

Month directory (create it if missing):

$(sase repo path research --ensure)/$(date +%Y%m)

Steps:

1. From the registered reports above, identify exactly one report per expected suffix
   in cld, mus, gem, belonging to this
   dispatch's `research.28.cld`, `research.28.mus`, `research.28.gem` dependencies, matching by `wait_name` and the canonical research
   label's existing `__<suffix>.md` suffix. Never reassign suffixes from list order.
   Open the research repo with `/sase_repo`, then read each report through its canonical
   research reference (or the `ref` field's `file:<id>` reference if the original has
   moved) using `sase artifact read`. Do not read predecessor chat transcripts. If the
   records above do not identify exactly one report per expected suffix, stop and report
   the missing or ambiguous input instead of guessing.
2. Research the request yourself, prioritizing gaps, weak evidence, and disagreements
   between the reports.
3. Pick a descriptive stem `<name>` that collides with nothing in the month directory
   (do NOT end the name with `_consolidated` or `_<YYYYmmdd>` or anything similar unless
   it relates to the research topic), create `<month-dir>/<name>/`, and move each report
   inside it as `<name>__<suffix>.md`, preserving its existing suffix. Each report's
   `source_path` is provenance for where it lives in your own opened research checkout;
   resolve its canonical repo-relative path there before moving it. Never modify the
   other agents' checkouts or the stored snapshot recorded at `ref` — only the copy in
   your own checkout moves. Preserve every file and never overwrite: on any collision,
   pick a different stem first.
4. Write the consolidated report to `<name>/<name>.md`: merge the strongest findings
   from every report above and your own research, resolve conflicts, cut duplication,
   and add missing critical context without unnecessary length.

Final layout:

```text
<month-dir>/<name>/
├── <name>__cld.md
├── <name>__mus.md
├── <name>__gem.md
└── <name>.md
