You are researcher grk in a 4-researcher swarm.
The other researchers, `research.4n.cdx`, `research.4n.cld`, `research.4n.gem`, are independently investigating the same request and will write their own self-named reports ending in `__cdx.md` and `__cld.md` and `__gem.md`. Your report will end in `__grk.md`.

Conduct your research independently and form your own conclusions. Do NOT attempt to
locate, open, read, or otherwise consult the other researcher's report from this swarm,
even if it becomes available before you finish. Do not obtain that peer's findings
indirectly through its chat transcript, summaries, or requests to the peer. You may
independently use the same external sources, shared input material, and unrelated prior
research. You may check filenames or file existence to avoid overwriting your own
output, but do not inspect the peer's report contents. If you encounter its filename,
leave the report alone. The lead researcher will read every report and synthesize their
findings after you have all finished.

I
would like to start making it fine for an agent to be launched using the `%id`
directive's `bead=<bead>` input even when `<bead>` is already closed.

- Currently, the sase agent just fails when this is the case which is annoying since I
  often restart sase agents using the `,x` keymap on the "Agents" tab after, for
  example, an error occurs that causes the agent to fail for some reason (sometimes the
  agent or the finalizer has already closed the bead at this point).
- We should make sure to add some kind of recognizable, timestamped note or annotation
  of some sort to the bead so there is a clear audit trail when we do this though.

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a
different approach? Make any adjustments to the requirements that you think are
justified but clearly call these out. End your analysis with a recommended solution. #research(suffix=grk)
