You are the lead researcher: two independent researchers have reported on the request
below, and you will add your own research and merge all three perspectives into one
consolidated report.

SASE derives your plan's links from the artifacts you read this turn; use
`sase artifact read` for context you actually used.

Research request:

I think that I have the Apollo machine set up correctly to
work with sase's new remote dispatch feature (see the sase-xe epic bead for context).
I'm not seeing any agents on the Fleet tab, however, even though there are several done
agents showing on the Apollo machine. There are a few open beads still associated with
this epic that are in progress now but I do not think any of them address this issue
directly.

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me understand what's causing this
issue, whether or not we can expect these issues to be fixed by the agents working the
corresponding open beads, and what action we should take otherwise? End your analysis
with a recommended solution.

The researchers' registered reports:

{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "markdown" and a.label and a.label.startswith("research:") %}
- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} source_path={{ a.source_path }} path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }}
{% endfor %}

Month directory (create it if missing):

$(sase repo path research --ensure)/$(date +%Y%m)

Steps:

1. From the registered reports above, identify the one distinct A report and the one
   distinct B report belonging to this dispatch's `research.1p.cdx` and
   `research.1p.cld` dependencies, matching by `wait_name` and the canonical research
   label's existing `__a.md`/`__b.md` suffix. Never reassign `__a`/`__b` from list order.
   Open the research repo with `/sase_repo`, then read each report through its canonical
   research reference (or the `ref` field's `file:<id>` reference if the original has
   moved) using `sase artifact read`. Do not read predecessor chat transcripts. If the
   records above do not identify exactly one A report and one B report, stop and report
   the missing or ambiguous input instead of guessing.
2. Research the request yourself, prioritizing gaps, weak evidence, and disagreements
   between the two reports.
3. Pick a descriptive stem `<name>` that collides with nothing in the month directory
   (do NOT end the name with `_consolidated` or `_<YYYYmmdd>` or anything similar unless
   it relates to the research topic), create `<month-dir>/<name>/`, and move the two
   reports inside it as `<name>__a.md` and `<name>__b.md`, preserving each report's
   existing `__a`/`__b` suffix. Each report's `source_path` is provenance for where it
   lives in your own opened research checkout; resolve its canonical repo-relative path
   there before moving it. Never modify the other agents' checkouts or the stored
   snapshot recorded at `ref` — only the copy in your own checkout moves. Preserve both
   files and never overwrite: on any collision, pick a different stem first.
4. Write the consolidated report to `<name>/<name>.md`: merge the strongest findings
   from both reports and your own research, resolve conflicts, cut duplication, and add
   missing critical context without unnecessary length.

Final layout:

```text
<month-dir>/<name>/
├── <name>__a.md
├── <name>__b.md
└── <name>.md
```
