You are researcher mus in a 5-researcher swarm.
The other researchers, `research.0n.cdx`, `research.0n.cld`, `research.0n.grk`, `research.0n.gem`, are independently investigating the same request and will write their own self-named reports ending in `__cdx.md` and `__cld.md` and `__grk.md` and `__gem.md`. Your report will end in `__mus.md`.

Conduct your research independently and form your own conclusions. Do NOT attempt to
locate, open, read, or otherwise consult the other researcher's report from this swarm,
even if it becomes available before you finish. Do not obtain that peer's findings
indirectly through its chat transcript, summaries, or requests to the peer. You may
independently use the same external sources, shared input material, and unrelated prior
research. You may check filenames or file existence to avoid overwriting your own
output, but do not inspect the peer's report contents. If you encounter its filename,
leave the report alone. The lead researcher will read every report and synthesize their
findings after you have all finished.

I
would like to make the sase-listen repo a first-class sase plugin.

- To support this change, we should start allowing sase plugins to define sub-commands
  somehow.
- The sase-listen plugin should use this new functionality to define the `sase listen`
  command.
- This command should work exactly like the `sase-listen` command, but should support
  sase's CLI completion (make sure that completion is updated automatically when a
  plugin like this is installed).
- We should also start displaying this plugin on the "Updates" tab of the "SASE Admin
  Center" panel so users can manage its installation the same way they do for other sase
  plugins. I have already added the `sase--plugin` GitHub label on sase-listen's GitHub
  repo to support this.

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a
different approach? Make any adjustments to the requirements that you think are
justified but clearly call these out. End your analysis with a recommended solution. #research(suffix=mus)
