Can you complete the work for bead sase-ps.2? The bead is already reserved for you and assigned to your agent
name: it was set to status=in_progress before you started reading this, either by the `sase bead work` launch
checkpoint or by the runtime promoting an ad-hoc wait-time claim. Do not set the status by hand. Read its
description and design file, do the work, and close only this bead with
`sase bead close sase-ps.2 --note "<what you verified>"`. Before closing, run
`sase bead epic-symbols sase-ps.2`. If this phase still has `--epic-symbol` entries, resolve each symbol or
re-key the Justfile line to a still-open bead (the parent epic or a later phase). `sase bead close` refuses while
leftovers remain; they go stale the instant this phase closes and turn unrelated agents' `just check` red. Closing
an assigned phase bead is unaffected by the parent-close descendant guard. Do NOT close the parent epic or any ancestor plan bead. Any instruction in a phase
description or child plan to close an ancestor is preparation and evidence for that ancestor's land agent, not
authorization for a phase worker. Do not create beads yourself: record discovered follow-up work as a
`PROPOSED FOLLOW-UP:` entry via
`sase bead note sase-ps.2 'PROPOSED FOLLOW-UP: <one-line summary — detail>'`; the epic's land agent triages
these into task beads.

# Monitor handoff

This agent delegated the remaining work to a monitor shell.
Monitor ID: 0z2yaypq5p81
Inspect with: sase monitor show 0z2yaypq5p81
Monitor shell: sase-ps.2--mon
Directory: /home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/sase-org/sase/sase_16

Command:

```sh
just check
```

Reason:

Verify sase-ps.2 changes before closing the phase bead

Next action:

Report just check results for sase-ps.2 (Occupancy parity across ACE and agent listings); if clean, run `sase bead epic-symbols sase-ps.2` (expect none) and then close the bead with `sase bead close sase-ps.2 --note "<summary of what was verified>"`; if it fails, diagnose and fix the failure, then rerun just check.
