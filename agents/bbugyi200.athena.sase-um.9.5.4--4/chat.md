**Why this was monitored:** Wait for Full CI 33240119114 on c1a5b36f5 so ci_watch can leave heavy_workflow_not_green

## Your next action

Continue bead sase-um.9.5.4 (ship). You are the same phase worker. Do NOT close parent sase-um.9.5 or any ancestor. Do NOT create beads; use PROPOSED FOLLOW-UP notes on sase-um.9.5.4. Do NOT hand-merge PR #284. Do NOT set status by hand. If this bead is closed, immediately run `sase bead open sase-um.9.5.4` — 9.5.5 is WAITING on it and v0.17.0 is unpublished. Mid-flight commits MUST use `sase_git_commit -B` (sase_final stitch auto-closes and would launch 9.5.5).

This monitor: Full CI 33240119114 (schedule, in_progress) on origin/master tip c1a5b36f5. Duplicate dispatch 33240160035 is pending behind it (concurrency group full-ci, cancel-in-progress:false). Both are the same SHA. Master Gate 33239974901 was in progress on c1a5b36f5. PR #284 OPEN MERGEABLE/CLEAN (head ebf8dfe8). publish.yml schedule 33239989521 succeeded; dispatch 33240161029 (publish_existing=false) was queued.

Landed this turn: c1a5b36f5 after Full CI 33232978442 on 49d6c4188 went RED. Failed nodes: (1) full/test(3.12) job 99053300955 — tests/fakey/test_pipe_e2e.py::test_default_pipe_creates_family_member_with_fork_and_shared_workspace used Claude default_model instead of inherited fakey (BrokenPipeError). (2) full/visual-test job 99053300958 — test_artifacts_files_empty_png_snapshot wait_for Alpha 15s. just check was green.

Then:
1. If this monitor timed out while 33240119114 is still pending or in_progress, re-issue `sase monitor start` watching 33240119114 (or 33240160035 / the newest Full CI on origin/master if that run finished or was superseded) with timeout at least 3h. Do not inline-wait Full CI.
2. If Full CI 33240119114 is red or cancelled, attribute failed nodes on the c1a5b36f5 run (ignore failures on 49d6c4188 and 623788895). If 33240119114 is cancelled but 33240160035 is still running on the same SHA, watch that run instead. Fix in-scope, `just check`, land with `sase_git_commit -B`, redispatch Full CI and publish.yml (publish_existing=false), confirm PR #284 is still MERGEABLE/CLEAN (re-dispatch publish.yml without publish_existing if CONFLICTING/DIRTY), and monitor the new Full CI (3h+). Do not mute flakes; record PROPOSED FOLLOW-UP.
3. If Full CI is green on c1a5b36f5 (or the newest Full CI on the integrated origin/master tip), dry-run ci_watch again. If still heavy_workflow_not_green, confirm the green Full CI SHA matches origin/master. Then watch live five-minute ci_watch ticks until sase-org/sase is eligible. The live `gh pr merge --merge --match-head-commit` is the acceptance evidence. Never hand-merge. Stay inside the 6-hour heavy window.
4. After #284 merges, let publish.yml tag and publish v0.17.0. Use workflow_dispatch publish_existing only if the three-hour schedule is the sole delay. Confirm the v0.17.0 tag, GitHub publish run, and PyPI 0.17.0.
5. Record all seven parent ACs numerically on this bead, then re-check plugin squash+empty allowlists and that telegram/github are not gating_workflow_missing or heavy_lane_not_green.
6. Baseline 2026-08-29T03:18Z before the tab-strip fix: (1) 1 cancelled in last 50 — 33127407974 test(1) failed then sibling shards cancelled under fail-fast:false, not push supersession; (2) trailing-49 completed median wall 9.02 min; (3) 39/39 master commits in 24h have a gate run, 38/39 completed; (4) ci_watch reasons are gating/heavy, never default_branch_not_green, not yet eligible; (5) #284 unmerged; (6) PR ci.yml pull_request queue p50 0s over 30 runs; (7) no v0.17.0 tag, PyPI 0.16.0.
7. Before close: `sase bead epic-symbols sase-um.9.5.4` and resolve leftovers. `just check` if you changed files. Then `sase bead close sase-um.9.5.4 --note "<what you verified>"` only.

Reason:

Wait for Full CI 33244467241 on ca7692ee3 so ci_watch can leave heavy_workflow_not_green

Next action:

Continue bead sase-um.9.5.4 (ship). You are the same phase worker. Do NOT close parent sase-um.9.5 or any ancestor. Do NOT create beads; use PROPOSED FOLLOW-UP notes on sase-um.9.5.4.

This monitor: Full CI 33244467241 (workflow_dispatch, in_progress) on origin/master tip ca7692ee3. Master Gate 33244341435 was in progress on ca7692ee3. PR #284 OPEN MERGEABLE/CLEAN (head ebf8dfe8). publish.yml 33244468516 (publish_existing=false) was in progress. Cancelled obsolete Full CI 33240160035 on c1a5b36f5 so this run would not queue behind it.

Landed this turn: ca7692ee3 after Full CI 33240119114 on c1a5b36f5 went RED. Failed nodes: (1) full/test(3.12) job 99068560982 — tests/test_running_agents_snapshot.py::test_list_all_agents_includes_done_and_failed missed TS_ACE_RUN_RETRIED_CHILD (20260427140500, pid 33333) because pid_is_thread treated a live host TID as the fixture process. test(3.14) and coverage-contexts green; visual-test green. (2) full/contention-test job 99068561001 — runner shutdown/cancel after the 3.12 failure, no harness assertion. just check was green (scoped 63 files).

Then:
1. If this monitor timed out while 33244467241 is still pending or in_progress, re-issue `sase monitor start` watching 33244467241 (or the newest Full CI on origin/master if that run finished or was superseded) with timeout at least 3h. Do not inline-wait Full CI.

Do not mute flakes; record PROPOSED FOLLOW-UP.
3. If Full CI is green on ca7692ee3 (or the newest Full CI on the integrated origin/master tip), dry-run ci_watch again.
