[validate_sase_core_rs_version] sase-core checkout is ahead of sase's compatibility window: source version 0.43.3 from /home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/sase-org/sase/sase_16/sase/repos/linked/sase-core/Cargo.toml does not satisfy `sase`'s `sase-core-rs==0.43.2` dependency in pyproject.toml. No action is needed: editable installs build from the checkout regardless, and `tools/ratchet_core_pin` moves the published pin on the release branch at release time.
[core-source] linked sase-core source changed since the extension was built; flagging an extension rebuild.
[setup] Note: the sase-core checkout is ahead of the published sase-core-rs pin in pyproject.toml; dev installs build from /home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/sase-org/sase/sase_16/sase/repos/linked/sase-core regardless. This is normal — the release-branch reconciler ratchets the published pin at release time, so no action is needed here.
[setup] Rebuilding sase_core_rs: linked sase-core source changed since the extension was built.

# Harden cargo crate downloads against transient crates.io flakiness.
# CI has hit `curl ... [16] Error in the HTTP2 framing layer` while
# maturin's `cargo metadata` fetches deps; disabling HTTP/2 multiplexing
# and raising the retry count makes the download resilient. Both are
# overridable from the environment.
# Capture the source identity after the checkout refresh above and before
# the build below. It is written to the venv only after a successful
# install (wheel-cache hit or `maturin develop` alike), so an edit made
# during the build still reads as stale on the next check.
