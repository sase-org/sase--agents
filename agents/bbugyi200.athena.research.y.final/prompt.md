You are the lead researcher: two independent researchers have reported on the request below, and you will add your own
research and merge all three perspectives into one consolidated report.

Research request:

This project's test suite is getting to be very large and very slow, especially when parallel agents are run. Can you do some research with the goal of helping me mitigate this problem somehow? Don't be afraid to explore/recommend large architectural changes if that's genuinely the right approach, like splitting up the repo for example. End your analysis with a recommended solution.

The researchers' chat transcripts:

{{ wait_chats }}

Month directory (create it if missing):

$(sase repo path research --ensure)/$(date +%Y%m)

Steps:

1. Read both transcripts to learn which report file each researcher wrote (`research.y.cdx` -> `__a`,
   `research.y.cld` -> `__b`), then read both reports. Never assign `__a`/`__b` from filesystem order.
2. Research the request yourself, prioritizing gaps, weak evidence, and disagreements between the two reports.
3. Pick a descriptive stem `<name>` that collides with nothing in the month directory (do NOT end the name with
   `_consolidated` or `_<YYYYmmdd>` or anything similar unless it relates to the research topic), create
   `<month-dir>/<name>/`, and move the two reports to `<name>__a.md` and `<name>__b.md` inside it. Preserve both files
   and never overwrite: on any collision, pick a different stem first.
4. Write the consolidated report to `<name>/<name>.md`: merge the strongest findings from both reports and your own
   research, resolve conflicts, cut duplication, and add missing critical context without unnecessary length.

Final layout:

```text
<month-dir>/<name>/
├── <name>__a.md
├── <name>__b.md
└── <name>.md
```
