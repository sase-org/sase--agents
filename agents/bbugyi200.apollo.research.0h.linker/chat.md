You are the linker agent for a research swarm. The lead researcher,
`research.0h.final`, has written a consolidated report on the request below. Your job
is to publish that report as the canonical `<name>.md`: the file readers open, and the
one SASE renders into a Highlights PDF. You are an editor, not a researcher. The new
file must carry exactly the lead's meaning and intent. Do not do research of your own:
add no new claims or sources, settle no open questions, and neither soften nor
strengthen the conclusions or the recommendation. If the lead seems wrong, leave it as
written. The only prose you write yourself is the short research-query summary of the
request that opens the file (step 3).

SASE derives your plan's links from the artifacts you read this turn; use
`sase artifact read` for context you actually used.

Research request (context only; do not research it, but summarize it as the file's
research query in step 3):

Can you do some research with the goal of comparing sase with omniagent (see the code
and documentation at https://github.com/omnigent-ai/omnigent for context)? End your
analysis with a ranked list of recommended changes you think I should consider making to
sase based on this comparison.

The lead researcher's registered report:

{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "markdown" and a.label and a.label.startswith("research:") %}
- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} source_path={{ a.source_path }} path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }}
{% endfor %}

The image agent's registered images:

{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "image" %}
- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} vcs_relpath={{ a.vcs_relpath }} path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }}
{% endfor %}


The audio agent's narrated edition:

{% if agents is defined %}{% for key, outputs in agents.items() if outputs.audio is defined %}
- agent={{ key }} audio={{ outputs.audio }}
{% endfor %}{% endif %}
{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "file" and a.label and a.label.startswith("audio:") %}
- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }}
{% endfor %}

Steps:

1. **Identify the source.** From the registered reports above, find exactly one entry
   with `wait_name` `research.0h.final` whose label has the form
   `research:<YYYYMM>/<name>/<name>__final.md`. If there is not exactly one such entry,
   stop and report the missing or ambiguous input instead of guessing. Open the research
   repo with `/sase_repo`, then read the report through its canonical research reference
   (or the `ref` field's `file:<id>` reference if the original has moved) using
   `sase artifact read`. Take `<YYYYMM>/<name>/` from the label, never from the current
   date. Do not read predecessor chat transcripts. Never modify, move, or delete
   `<name>__final.md` or the drafts.

2. **Inventory what must survive.** Before writing, list every finding, recommendation,
   caveat, open question, confidence statement, number, date, version, code block,
   table, and link in the lead's report.
3. **Restructure** the lead's report into a well-thought-out organization:
   - Keep the frontmatter, updating `updated_time` if present.
   - **Open the file in this exact order**, with nothing else between these parts: the frontmatter (if any), one `#` title, the research query, the listen card, the infographic, and then the bottom-line section.
   - **Research query.** Directly below the title, add one blockquote that summarizes
     the research request above in one to three sentences, for example
     `> **Research query:** <summary>`. Phrase it as the question or task being
     answered, in the requester's own terms: keep the questions, named subjects, and
     explicit scope or constraints; drop instructions aimed at agents, such as output
     paths, macro or directive syntax, and formatting requests. Summarize what was
     asked, not material the request quotes or attaches. Use a request that is already
     one short sentence verbatim. Never fold findings, answers, or scope the request
     does not state into it. It is not a heading, so it gets no section number and no
     TOC entry.
   - **Listen card.** Facts come from the `audio` variable of `research.0h.audio`
     when `ok` is true. If the variable is missing but an `audio:<episode_id>`
     artifact is listed, recover the facts with `sase-listen ls <episode_id> --json`
     (or `uvx sase-listen …`): `audio.duration_s`, chapter count, `script.edition`.
     If `ok` is false or nothing is listed, publish with no card and no `audio:`
     frontmatter, and say so in the final response (never write "audio pending").
     Add this frontmatter mapping (create a frontmatter block if the lead's report
     has none), copying numbers verbatim, never inventing them:

     ```yaml
     audio:
       edition: brief
       duration_s: 250.34
       chapter_count: 3
       episode_id: a-listen-link-for-research-reports-d74298
     ```

     No library path, MP3 path, feed URL, artifact id, or `file:` ref — the research
     repo is public. Insert the card exactly once, directly below the research-query
     blockquote and above the infographic, with the blank lines shown (they make
     GitHub and pandoc parse the inner Markdown):

     ```markdown
     <div class="listen">

     ♫ **Brief audio edition** · 4 min · 3 chapters · [Narration
     script](<name>_narration.md)

     </div>
     ```

     Rules: edition word capitalized (`Brief` / `Full`); minutes =
     `max(1, round(duration_s / 60))`; `1 chapter` singular; drop the chapters
     segment if the count is unknown; include the script segment only when
     `<name>_narration.md` exists beside the report in the research checkout;
     nothing else inside the div; not a heading; not inside the blockquote; never
     a link to an MP3, library path, feed URL, or `highlights://` URI.
   - **Embed the infographic** exactly once, directly above the bottom-line section:
     after the listen card and before that section's `##` heading, never further
     down. Use a relative link with descriptive alt text, for example
     `![<alt text>](<name>_infographic.png)`. Locate it by the
     `<name>_infographic.png` convention or the image entries above. Embed only a file
     you have confirmed exists beside the report in your research checkout. If the
     image agent completed without producing one, publish without it (the listen
     card then sits directly above the bottom-line section) and say so in the final
     response.
   - **Bottom-line section.** The first `##` section is `## Bottom line` (or
     `## Overview` when the report surveys options rather than giving one answer) and
     gives the answer first.
   - Below it, `##` and `###` sections ordered by the questions a reader will ask, with
     duplicated passages merged.
   - **Never number headings.** The PDF renderer runs pandoc with `--number-sections`,
     so hand-numbered headings render doubly numbered.
   - **No table of contents and no block of jump links.** The PDF already gets a TOC.
   - Keep the lead's wording where it works. Never drop a claim, caveat, or source to
     save space. If the lead's report restates the question or lists its inputs, keep
     those details in a later section; the research query summarizes the request but
     does not replace them.
4. **Validate every link carried over.**
   - Relative links resolve from `<YYYYMM>/<name>/`, and in-document anchors resolve
     against the final headings. Both are hard requirements.
   - Check external URLs with `curl -fsSL -o /dev/null --max-time 20 <url>`, retrying
     a transient failure once. Treat 401, 403, 429, and timeouts as _unverified_ and
     keep those links.
   - Verify repository-file links through a `/sase_repo` checkout, not by fetching
     github.com.
   - Repair a link only when the right target is certain: a followed redirect, a moved
     file, an obvious typo, or a renamed heading. For an unrepairable link, keep its
     text, drop the dead URL, and list it in the final response. **Never search for a
     replacement source.**

5. **Add in-document links** so readers can jump between parts of the file. Add them
   inline and sparingly: from summary points to the sections that back them, from "see
   above" or "see below" phrases, and from mentions of a named option, phase, or
   finding to where it is discussed. Do not link every mention.
   - Every heading used as a link target must start with a letter, contain only
     letters, digits, spaces, and hyphens, and be unique. Its anchor is then the
     lowercased heading with spaces replaced by hyphens, for example
     `[the bottom line](#bottom-line)`. pandoc (the PDF) and GitHub then agree.
   - Move emoji, version numbers, and code out of such headings, into the section's
     first line.
   - When `pandoc` is available, confirm anchors with `pandoc <file> -t html`.

6. **Re-check against the step-2 inventory** and restore anything missing or changed.
   Every URL in `<name>__final.md` must appear in the new file unless it was listed as
   unrepairable. Then confirm the file opens in the step-3 order: title, research query, listen card, infographic, bottom-line section.

7. **Write** `<YYYYMM>/<name>/<name>.md` without overwrite. On a collision, stop and
   report it.

8. **Register** it as a durable snapshot:

   sase artifact create -p "<absolute-report-path>" -l "research:<repo-relative-report-path>"

   Use the report's actual absolute path and its path relative to the research repo
   root, for example `research:202609/<name>/<name>.md`. Use no `--move`. If
   registration fails, report it and do not claim full completion.

## Response

I've read the lead's report (643 lines) and am now checking its links and inputs before restructuring it.

I wrote a sentence of my own into the rank-6 recommendation. I'll take it out and put the full wording back in the heading instead.

Now validating anchors with pandoc, relative links, and the opening order.

Every anchor and relative link resolves. Next I'm checking the new file against the lead's report word by word, so nothing gets dropped.

The diff is noisy because I moved sections, so I'm switching to a sentence-by-sentence check.

Registered. Now submitting the final declaration.

The lead's report is now published as the reader-facing file at `202610/omnigent_meta_harness_lessons_for_sase/omnigent_meta_harness_lessons_for_sase.md`. It is registered as `file:explicit:6bc3adf4c45286f1328190a0`, and the research repo's commit is declared. The host makes the commit after this turn ends. I did not change the lead's report or the drafts.

- **Opening order:** the file opens with the frontmatter, the title and a one-sentence research query. Then come the listen card (Brief audio edition, 5 min, 3 chapters, linked to the narration script), the infographic, and the bottom-line section. Both audio files and the infographic exist beside the report, so nothing was left out.
- **Structure:** the order is Bottom line, Side by side, What SASE already does better, Ranked recommendations, Not recommended, Scope and inputs, Where the reports disagreed, Caveats, Sources.
  - **Ranked recommendations:** the summary table now opens this section, with each row linking to its recommendation. Rank and effort moved out of the headings into each recommendation's first line, since headings can't be numbered.
  - **Date, subjects and inputs:** the lead's header block with these details is now the "Scope and inputs" section.
  - **Cross-references:** each "§3 #N" reference is now a link to the disagreements table. The bottom-line bullets link to the recommendations that back them.
  - **Sources:** I added relative links to the five input reports and to the earlier OpenAI report, which the lead already named.
- **Content check:** a sentence-by-sentence comparison found nothing dropped. The only differences are the reworded headings, the effort labels moved out of them, and the "§" references now written as links. Every inline code span and figure is still there. pandoc confirmed that all 62 anchor and relative links resolve.
- **External links:**
  - **Repaired:** the Claude Code sandboxing docs link appears twice, and both now point to `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sandboxing`, where the old `docs.claude.com` address redirects.
  - **Kept but unverified:** the IT Brief article returned 403.
  - **Checked:** the other URLs returned 200, and I confirmed the Omnigent commit link in a local checkout of the repo.
  - **Removed:** none.
