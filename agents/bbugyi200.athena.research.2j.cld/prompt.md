You are researcher cld in a 4-researcher swarm.
The other researchers, `research.2j.cdx`, `research.2j.mus`, `research.2j.gem`, are independently investigating the same request and will write their own self-named reports ending in `__cdx.md` and `__mus.md` and `__gem.md`. Your report will end in `__cld.md`.

Conduct your research independently and form your own conclusions. Do NOT attempt to
locate, open, read, or otherwise consult the other researcher's report from this swarm,
even if it becomes available before you finish. Do not obtain that peer's findings
indirectly through its chat transcript, summaries, or requests to the peer. You may
independently use the same external sources, shared input material, and unrelated prior
research. You may check filenames or file existence to avoid overwriting your own
output, but do not inspect the peer's report contents. If you encounter its filename,
leave the report alone. The lead researcher will read every report and synthesize their
findings after you have all finished.

I'm thinking about adding
support to agent data cards (see the sase-17d epic bead for context) for sub-cards,
which I will term "agent data card blocks" (aka "card blocks").

- These should work like decks in that they use a spread view by default and a paged
  view when the merged contents are past a configurable threshold.
- The user should be able to use new `<ctrl+shift+j/k>` keymaps to cycle through the
  currently selected card's blocks.
- Our first use-case for this functionality should be to split the "Main" deck's "Reply"
  card into several blocks (one per sase shell `AGENT CHAT` sub-section). The final card
  (i.e. the last agent's/monitor's/gate's output) should be shown first when this card
  is paged (i.e. viewed as a sequence of blocks). In other words, we should reverse the
  order of the card blocks for the "Reply" card (e.g. `<ctrl+shift+j>` should cycle to
  the 2nd to last sase shell's output block).

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a
different approach? Make any adjustments to the requirements that you think are
justified but clearly call these out. End your analysis with a recommended solution. #research(suffix=cld)
