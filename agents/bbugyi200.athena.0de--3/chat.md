# Monitor handoff

This agent delegated the remaining work to a monitor shell.
Monitor ID: pa1ejgyk8vwn
Inspect with: sase monitor show pa1ejgyk8vwn
Monitor shell: 0de--mon
Directory: /home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/sase-org/sase/sase_28

Command:

```sh
just check-full
```

Reason:

Verify the ,x relaunch-cleanup-barrier plan before finishing (kill_and_edit_prompt_latency.md)

Next action:

Report just check-full results for the ,x relaunch-cleanup-barrier plan (kill_and_edit_prompt_latency.md): summarize pass/fail and fix any failures. Source changes: new module src/sase/ace/tui/actions/agent_workflow/_relaunch_barrier.py; _finish_kill_and_edit_agent in _entry_relaunch.py and _bulk_kill_marked_agents_and_edit in _marking_kill.py now mount the prompt bar/stack immediately and open a barrier instead of waiting for cleanup settlement; _dismiss_done_agent/_do_kill_agent/_do_bulk_kill_agents now return bool; _submit_resolved_launch in _launch_start.py gates on the barrier. Tests: new tests/ace/tui/test_kill_and_edit_launch_barrier.py replaces the deleted test_kill_and_edit_deferred_settlement.py; updated test doubles in _retry_edit_agent_name_helpers.py, test_agent_bulk_kill_edit.py, test_family_member_relaunch.py to return bool/add display_name. just lint already passes.

Directory: /home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/sase-org/sase/sase_28

Command:

```sh
just check-full
```

Reason:

Verify the ,x relaunch-cleanup-barrier plan (kill_and_edit_prompt_latency.md); prior run timed out at 45m with zero output after lint, consistent with host worker-token lease contention, not a hang: directly relevant tests (new test_kill_and_edit_launch_barrier.py, test_agent_bulk_kill_edit.py, test_family_member_relaunch.py) all pass in isolation in a few seconds

Next action:

Report just check-full results for the ,x relaunch-cleanup-barrier plan (kill_and_edit_prompt_latency.md): summarize pass/fail and fix any real failures. If it timed out again with no output beyond lint/committed-plans, that is host lease contention, not a code bug (already verified: 11/11 new barrier tests + test_agent_bulk_kill_edit.py + test_family_member_relaunch.py all pass standalone in ~7s). In that case just report the contention and that implementation is verified complete via the standalone runs. If it completes, report pass/fail and fix any genuine failures.

## Your next action

Report just check-full results for the ,x relaunch-cleanup-barrier plan (kill_and_edit_prompt_latency.md): summarize pass/fail and fix any real failures. If it timed out again with no output beyond lint/committed-plans, that is host lease contention, not a code bug (already verified: 11/11 new barrier tests + test_agent_bulk_kill_edit.py + test_family_member_relaunch.py all pass standalone in ~7s). In that case just report the contention and that implementation is verified complete via the standalone runs. If it completes, report pass/fail and fix any genuine failures.
%xprompts_enabled:true

## Response

This confirms the failure is unrelated to our plan: `tests/sdd_store/test_sidecar_clone.py` wasn't touched by our changes, and the failure is a deterministic `ImportError` from a stale `monkeypatch.setattr("sase.sdd._store_link.time.sleep", ...)` target — commit `51f6369b3` ("refactor(sdd): split store-link clone helpers") moved the sleep/retry logic into `_store_clone_ops.py` but left the test patching the old dotted path. Let me file this as a task bead before reporting.

Now let me search for existing duplicate task beads before creating a new one.

A duplicate already exists: `sase-tl`. Let me check its status and details before corroborating.

This is an exact semantic duplicate (already `READY`, filed ~57 minutes ago from a different epic's land phase). Per policy, I'll corroborate with a `+1` instead of creating a new task.

Now finalizing the turn per the SASE workflow.

`just check-full` passed for the relaunch-cleanup-barrier plan: 36814 passed, 13 skipped, and the one failure (`test_sidecar_clone_retries_transient_transport_failures`) is a pre-existing, unrelated stale-monkeypatch bug from an earlier `_store_link.py` refactor — already tracked as bead `sase-tl`, which I corroborated with independent reproduction evidence rather than filing a duplicate. The kill-and-edit relaunch-barrier implementation is verified complete and the changes have been committed.
