Can you complete the work for bead sase-zl.13.11.5? The bead is already reserved for you and assigned to your agent
name: it was set to status=in_progress before you started reading this, either by the `sase bead work` launch
checkpoint or by the runtime promoting an ad-hoc wait-time claim. Do not set the status by hand. Read its
description and design file, do the work, and close only this bead with
`sase bead close sase-zl.13.11.5 --note "<what you verified>"`. Before closing, run
`sase bead epic-symbols sase-zl.13.11.5`. If this phase still has `--epic-symbol` entries, resolve each symbol or
re-key the Justfile line to a still-open bead (the parent epic or a later phase). `sase bead close` refuses while
leftovers remain; they go stale the instant this phase closes and turn unrelated agents' `just check` red. Closing
an assigned phase bead is unaffected by the parent-close descendant guard. Do NOT close the parent epic or any ancestor plan bead. Any instruction in a phase
description or child plan to close an ancestor is preparation and evidence for that ancestor's land agent, not
authorization for a phase worker. Do not create beads yourself: record discovered follow-up work as a
`PROPOSED FOLLOW-UP:` entry via
`sase bead note sase-zl.13.11.5 'PROPOSED FOLLOW-UP: <one-line summary — detail>'`; the epic's land agent triages
these into task beads.

## Response

# Monitor handoff

This agent delegated the remaining work to a monitor shell.
Monitor ID: tga5qv34n948
Inspect with: sase monitor show tga5qv34n948
Monitor shell: sase-zl.13.11.5--mon
Directory: /home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/sase-org/sase/sase_11

Command:

```sh
set -e
export PYO3_PYTHON="/home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/sase-org/sase/sase_11/.venv/bin/python"
export SASE_CORE_DIR="/home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/sase-org/sase/sase_11/sase/repos/external/gh/sase-org/sase-core"
cd "$SASE_CORE_DIR" && just check
cd /home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/sase-org/sase/sase_11 && just check
```

Reason:

Verify ancestry_retention core and SASE trees before closing sase-zl.13.11.5

Next action:

Complete bead sase-zl.13.11.5 after the monitored verification.

The bead is already reserved and in_progress. Do not set status by hand. Do not close the parent epic or any ancestor. Do not create beads; record discovered follow-up as `sase bead note sase-zl.13.11.5 'PROPOSED FOLLOW-UP: ...'`.

This phase implemented continuation ancestry retention:
- Rust `plan_continuation_retention` in opened sase-core (`sase/repos/external/gh/sase-org/sase-core`) with PyO3 binding `continuation_plan_retention`.
- ACE-run planner now walks live/recoverable continuation parent IDs and starter dirs so referenced old ancestry is excluded from deletion; after a safe terminal disposition it can be reclaimed. Apply re-checks the closure so concurrent publication cannot delete newly referenced ancestry. Temporary trees only.
- Required portable registration of checkpoints, monitor results/nodes, intents, and agent-delta content through existing artifact APIs; locators live in `continuation/portable_locators.json` and agent_meta. Optional debug capture still swallows failures. Continuation-portable index rows do not permanently pin source run dirs.
- Replay resolves local refs via those portable locators after local files are gone.
- Drive-by: renamed in-file-only `apply_resume_adoption` to `_apply_resume_adoption` so Symvision passes.

If the monitored command failed, fix the reported failures, re-run the needed verification, and only then close.

Before closing: run `sase bead epic-symbols sase-zl.13.11.5`. If this phase still has `--epic-symbol` entries, resolve each symbol or re-key the Justfile line to a still-open bead. Then close only this bead with `sase bead close sase-zl.13.11.5 --note "<what you verified>"` naming exact tests and that no production cleanup was applied. New Rust API must not ratchet the published sase-core-rs floor in pyproject.toml.

Use `/sase_final` before the normal end-of-turn response. Commit both the sase workspace and the opened sase-core repo.
