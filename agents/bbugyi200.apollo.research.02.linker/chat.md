You are the linker agent for a research swarm. The lead researcher,
`research.02.final`, has written a consolidated report on the request below. Your job
is to publish that report as the canonical `<name>.md`: the file readers open, and the
one SASE renders into a Highlights PDF. You are an editor, not a researcher. The new
file must carry exactly the lead's meaning and intent. Do not do research of your own:
add no new claims or sources, settle no open questions, and neither soften nor
strengthen the conclusions or the recommendation. If the lead seems wrong, leave it as
written. The only prose you write yourself is the short research-query summary of the
request that opens the file (step 3).

SASE derives your plan's links from the artifacts you read this turn; use
`sase artifact read` for context you actually used.

Research request (context only; do not research it, but summarize it as the file's
research query in step 3):

I
would love to be able to reduce this project's agent instruction files down to <=100
lines. Sase has pretty good support for progressive disclosure with memory files
already.

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a
different approach? Make any adjustments to the requirements that you think are
justified but clearly call these out. End your analysis with a recommended solution.

The lead researcher's registered report:

{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "markdown" and a.label and a.label.startswith("research:") %}
- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} source_path={{ a.source_path }} path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }}
{% endfor %}

The image agent's registered images:

{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "image" %}
- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} vcs_relpath={{ a.vcs_relpath }} path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }}
{% endfor %}

Steps:

1. **Identify the source.** From the registered reports above, find exactly one entry
   with `wait_name` `research.02.final` whose label has the form
   `research:<YYYYMM>/<name>/<name>__final.md`. If there is not exactly one such entry,
   stop and report the missing or ambiguous input instead of guessing. Open the research
   repo with `/sase_repo`, then read the report through its canonical research reference
   (or the `ref` field's `file:<id>` reference if the original has moved) using
   `sase artifact read`. Take `<YYYYMM>/<name>/` from the label, never from the current
   date. Do not read predecessor chat transcripts. Never modify, move, or delete
   `<name>__final.md` or the drafts.

2. **Inventory what must survive.** Before writing, list every finding, recommendation,
   caveat, open question, confidence statement, number, date, version, code block,
   table, and link in the lead's report.
3. **Restructure** the lead's report into a well-thought-out organization:
   - Keep the frontmatter, updating `updated_time` if present.
   - **Open the file in this exact order**, with nothing else between these parts: the frontmatter (if any), one `#` title, the research query, the infographic, and then the bottom-line section.
   - **Research query.** Directly below the title, add one blockquote that summarizes
     the research request above in one to three sentences, for example
     `> **Research query:** <summary>`. Phrase it as the question or task being
     answered, in the requester's own terms: keep the questions, named subjects, and
     explicit scope or constraints; drop instructions aimed at agents, such as output
     paths, xprompt or directive syntax, and formatting requests. Summarize what was
     asked, not material the request quotes or attaches. Use a request that is already
     one short sentence verbatim. Never fold findings, answers, or scope the request
     does not state into it. It is not a heading, so it gets no section number and no
     TOC entry.
   - **Embed the infographic** exactly once, directly above the bottom-line section:
     after the research query and before that section's `##` heading, never further
     down. Use a relative link with descriptive alt text, for example
     `![<alt text>](<name>_infographic.png)`. Locate it by the
     `<name>_infographic.png` convention or the image entries above. Embed only a file
     you have confirmed exists beside the report in your research checkout. If the
     image agent completed without producing one, publish without it (the research
     query then sits directly above the bottom-line section) and say so in the final
     response.
   - **Bottom-line section.** The first `##` section is `## Bottom line` (or
     `## Overview` when the report surveys options rather than giving one answer) and
     gives the answer first.
   - Below it, `##` and `###` sections ordered by the questions a reader will ask, with
     duplicated passages merged.
   - **Never number headings.** The PDF renderer runs pandoc with `--number-sections`,
     so hand-numbered headings render doubly numbered.
   - **No table of contents and no block of jump links.** The PDF already gets a TOC.
   - Keep the lead's wording where it works. Never drop a claim, caveat, or source to
     save space. If the lead's report restates the question or lists its inputs, keep
     those details in a later section; the research query summarizes the request but
     does not replace them.
4. **Validate every link carried over.**
   - Relative links resolve from `<YYYYMM>/<name>/`, and in-document anchors resolve
     against the final headings. Both are hard requirements.
   - Check external URLs with `curl -fsSL -o /dev/null --max-time 20 <url>`, retrying
     a transient failure once. Treat 401, 403, 429, and timeouts as _unverified_ and
     keep those links.
   - Verify repository-file links through a `/sase_repo` checkout, not by fetching
     github.com.
   - Repair a link only when the right target is certain: a followed redirect, a moved
     file, an obvious typo, or a renamed heading. For an unrepairable link, keep its
     text, drop the dead URL, and list it in the final response. **Never search for a
     replacement source.**

5. **Add in-document links** so readers can jump between parts of the file. Add them
   inline and sparingly: from summary points to the sections that back them, from "see
   above" or "see below" phrases, and from mentions of a named option, phase, or
   finding to where it is discussed. Do not link every mention.
   - Every heading used as a link target must start with a letter, contain only
     letters, digits, spaces, and hyphens, and be unique. Its anchor is then the
     lowercased heading with spaces replaced by hyphens, for example
     `[the bottom line](#bottom-line)`. pandoc (the PDF) and GitHub then agree.
   - Move emoji, version numbers, and code out of such headings, into the section's
     first line.
   - When `pandoc` is available, confirm anchors with `pandoc <file> -t html`.

6. **Re-check against the step-2 inventory** and restore anything missing or changed.
   Every URL in `<name>__final.md` must appear in the new file unless it was listed as
   unrepairable. Then confirm the file opens in the step-3 order: title, research query, infographic, bottom-line section.

7. **Write** `<YYYYMM>/<name>/<name>.md` without overwrite. On a collision, stop and
   report it.

8. **Register** it as a durable snapshot:

   sase artifact create -p "<absolute-report-path>" -l "research:<repo-relative-report-path>"

   Use the report's actual absolute path and its path relative to the research repo
   root, for example `research:202609/<name>/<name>.md`. Use no `--move`. If
   registration fails, report it and do not claim full completion.

## Response

Reading done; now checking the raw file's frontmatter and the external links before restructuring.

Now writing the restructured canonical report (no frontmatter in source; all 6 external URLs return 200; infographic confirmed present).

Now validating anchors with pandoc and checking that nothing from the source was dropped.

All anchors resolve and URLs match. Checking that every number and code span from the source survived:

The sentence diff shows only intended changes (§ refs → links, heading renames, metadata line moved). Re-running the number check properly:

Only section numbers and § references are absent, as intended. Registering the artifact:

Registered. Now the final declaration.

The lead's report is now published as `202610/agent_instructions_budgeted_router/agent_instructions_budgeted_router.md` and registered as `file:explicit:280727b043b9e57166436397`. The host commits it to the research repo after this turn ends.

- **Source:** There was exactly one `research.02.final` entry. I read it with `sase artifact read` and did not touch the `__final.md` file or the drafts. The source had no frontmatter, so there was no `updated_time` to update.
- **Opening order:** the title, then a two-sentence research query blockquote, then the infographic, then `## Bottom line`. I checked that `agent_instructions_budgeted_router_infographic.png` exists in the same folder, and it is embedded once with a relative link.
- **Structure:**
  - **Headings:** I removed every hand-added section number. I took parentheticals like "(verified)", "(new)" and "(separate from this effort)" out of the headings and put them in each section's first line, so every anchor is clean.
  - **Moved sections:** the italic line naming the lead, inputs, checkout and scope became a short "Scope and inputs" section. The appendix became "Target line budget" under "Recommended solution", so the report still ends with the recommendation as requested.
  - **Links:** every `§` cross-reference is now a working in-document link, and I added a few more from summary points to the sections that back them.
- **Content check:** I compared the new file against the original sentence by sentence and also compared every number, code span and table row. The only differences are the removed section numbers, the `§` references, and the heading changes above. All 88 table rows, the eight hard rules, the adjustments A–H and every caveat are still there.
- **Links:** all six external URLs returned HTTP 200 and are carried over unchanged, so none had to be dropped. The source had no relative links. Running the file through pandoc confirmed that all 13 in-document link targets match a heading.
