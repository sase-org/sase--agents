You are researcher mus in a 5-researcher swarm.
The other researchers, `research.0g.cdx`, `research.0g.cld`, `research.0g.grk`, `research.0g.gem`, are independently investigating the same request and will write their own self-named reports ending in `__cdx.md` and `__cld.md` and `__grk.md` and `__gem.md`. Your report will end in `__mus.md`.

Conduct your research independently and form your own conclusions. Do NOT attempt to
locate, open, read, or otherwise consult the other researcher's report from this swarm,
even if it becomes available before you finish. Do not obtain that peer's findings
indirectly through its chat transcript, summaries, or requests to the peer. You may
independently use the same external sources, shared input material, and unrelated prior
research. You may check filenames or file existence to avoid overwriting your own
output, but do not inspect the peer's report contents. If you encounter its filename,
leave the report alone. The lead researcher will read every report and synthesize their
findings after you have all finished.

I
would like to give sase plans (i.e. tales and epics) the ability to embed sase gate
options within their frontmatter somehow.

- This will be useful, for example, to start requiring that all memory file changes be
  planned in plan files with explicit human gates (that should default to on iff the
  user explicitly requested those memory changes).
- This will also be useful if, for example, a sase agent has a question for the user
  that effects the plan but the agent has enough information to write a good plan
  without an immediate answer (i.e. the coder agent can implement the plan based on what
  gate selections the user made).
- I have already done some research on this, which can be found in the
  plan_frontmatter_decisions.md file in the research sidecar repo. Review that research
  before performing your own. I agree with all of the recommendations made in that
  research file (though your judgement should take priority when it comes to UX
  decisions).
- I want you to lead the design on this one. Make sure you design this feature so it is intuitive, reliable, and (last but not least) beautiful!

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide what the best possible UX
looks like (across the TUI, Telegram, and the CLI) for this functionality? 
Write this research to a new markdown file under the $(sase repo path research --ensure)/$(date +%Y%m)/ directory.
Choose a descriptive filename stem yourself, but the filename MUST end with the
`__mus` suffix, i.e. `<stem>__mus.md` (double underscore before the
suffix). Create the report without overwrite: if the exact file already exists, pick a
different stem instead of replacing it.


After the write succeeds, register the report as a durable snapshot:

sase artifact create -p "<absolute-report-path>" -l "research:<repo-relative-report-path>"

Use the report's actual absolute path and its path relative to the research repo root
(for example `research:202609/topic__a.md`), including any subdirectory the steps above
put it in. Do not derive the label from the current month, the clock, or a guessed name.
Do not pass `--move`; the source stays in the research repo for later reorganization. If
registration itself fails, report that failure — do not report the research task as
fully complete.

## Response

Research complete. Report written and registered.

- Report: `sase/repos/research/202610/plan_embedded_gates_ux__mus.md` (528 lines) — independent UX design for plan-embedded reviewer choices across TUI, Telegram, and CLI.
- Bottom line: ship typed `decisions:` compiled to inputs on `approve`, not embedded gate options. TUI gets an always-visible Decisions section above a renamed Verdict plus a new bool toggle, outcome sentence, and `•` changed markers; Telegram gets Approve-as-shown plus a typed step flow with a new yes/no keyboard; CLI gets repeatable `-D id=value`, fail-before-side-effect errors, `--dry-run`, and a `plan show` table.
- Prior work reviewed via audited reads: `research:202610/plan_frontmatter_decisions/plan_frontmatter_decisions.md`; I agree with all its recommendations. Peer swarm reports were not opened (filenames only).
- Registered: `sase artifact create` succeeded (`ref: file:explicit:764736f07a740c4e2ca425bf`).
- Final declaration accepted for the research repo commit.
