## Prompt

sase monitor start --command 'just check' --reason 'Rerun lint+scoped tests after fixing ruff format failure in test_memory_panel.py for the memory_pane_interactive_read plan'

## Response

[validate_sase_core_rs_version] sase-core checkout is ahead of sase's compatibility window: source version 0.32.4 from /home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/sase-org/sase/sase_19/sase/repos/linked/sase-core/Cargo.toml does not satisfy `sase`'s `sase-core-rs>=0.31.12,<0.32.0` dependency in pyproject.toml. No action is needed: editable installs build from the checkout regardless, and `tools/ratchet_core_window` moves the published window on the release branch at release time.
[setup] Note: the sase-core checkout is ahead of the published sase-core-rs window in pyproject.toml; dev installs build from /home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/sase-org/sase/sase_19/sase/repos/linked/sase-core regardless. This is normal — the release-branch reconciler ratchets the published window at release time, so no action is needed here.
