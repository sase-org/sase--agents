[validate_sase_core_rs_version] sase-core checkout is ahead of sase's compatibility window: source version 0.32.3 from /home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/sase-org/sase/sase_20/sase/repos/linked/sase-core/Cargo.toml does not satisfy `sase`'s `sase-core-rs>=0.31.12,<0.32.0` dependency in pyproject.toml. No action is needed: editable installs build from the checkout regardless, and `tools/ratchet_core_window` moves the published window on the release branch at release time.
[validate_sase_core_rs] installed sase-core-rs distribution version 0.32.2 disagrees with the /home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/sase-org/sase/sase_20/sase/repos/linked/sase-core/Cargo.toml checkout version 0.32.3; the checkout moved and the extension was not rebuilt. Run `just install`.
[setup] Note: the sase-core checkout is ahead of the published sase-core-rs window in pyproject.toml; dev installs build from /home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/sase-org/sase/sase_20/sase/repos/linked/sase-core regardless. This is normal — the release-branch reconciler ratchets the published window at release time, so no action is needed here.

## Your next action

Read /tmp/just_check_output.log and the monitor output for `just check` run against bead sase-sq.7.1.3 (strand-backed glossary catalog and fail-closed dual truth, in workspace sase_20). If it passed cleanly, run `sase bead epic-symbols sase-sq.7.1.3` (expect no leftover --epic-symbol entries; if there are any, resolve them per phase-bead instructions before closing) and then close the bead with `sase bead close sase-sq.7.1.3 --note "<summarize what was verified: just check clean, targeted pytest suites (memory/web catalog, xprompt glossary catalog, init_memory glossary, doctor memory webs, ACE glossary panel, memory cli_common) passing, ruff/mypy/format clean, and the sase/memory/glossary.md + README.md drift already committed to match the marker removal>". Do NOT close the parent epic or any ancestor bead. If `just check` failed, diagnose and fix the failures in the sase-sq.7.1.3 diff (strand-backed glossary catalog changes across src/sase/memory/web/, src/sase/xprompt/glossary_catalog.py, src/sase/main/init_memory/glossary.py, src/sase/doctor/checks_config_memory_webs.py, src/sase/ace/tui/glossary_panel_catalog.py, src/sase/memory/cli_common.py, plus tests), rerun just check (inline or via another monitor if still slow), and only then close the bead the same way.
