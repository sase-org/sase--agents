You are researcher mus in a 5-researcher swarm.
The other researchers, `research.2p.cdx`, `research.2p.cld`, `research.2p.grk`, `research.2p.gem`, are independently investigating the same request and will write their own self-named reports ending in `__cdx.md` and `__cld.md` and `__grk.md` and `__gem.md`. Your report will end in `__mus.md`.

Conduct your research independently and form your own conclusions. Do NOT attempt to
locate, open, read, or otherwise consult the other researcher's report from this swarm,
even if it becomes available before you finish. Do not obtain that peer's findings
indirectly through its chat transcript, summaries, or requests to the peer. You may
independently use the same external sources, shared input material, and unrelated prior
research. You may check filenames or file existence to avoid overwriting your own
output, but do not inspect the peer's report contents. If you encounter its filename,
leave the report alone. The lead researcher will read every report and synthesize their
findings after you have all finished.

I would like to add support to sase for detailed usage tracking somehow.

- We will need to make sure this doesn't hurt performance too much (the TUI is already
  too slow, for example).
- The goal of this change is to help me understand which parts of sase I never use.
  After a month or two of monitored use, for example, I would like to go through this
  data and use it to help me find functionality that should be deleted.
- We will eventually want to support allowing external users to opt-in to periodically
  packaging up this usage data and sending it to one of my servers for analysis, so it
  is important that we don't store any sensitive data.
- I will need some way to visualize my usage of sase after I have enough data. Think
  hard about what the best UX for this functionality looks like.

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a
different approach? Make any adjustments to the requirements that you think are
justified but clearly call these out. End your analysis with a recommended solution. #research(suffix=mus)
