## Response

[validate_sase_core_rs_version] sase-core checkout is ahead of sase's compatibility window: source version 0.32.3 from /home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/sase-org/sase/sase_20/sase/repos/linked/sase-core/Cargo.toml does not satisfy `sase`'s `sase-core-rs>=0.31.12,<0.32.0` dependency in pyproject.toml. No action is needed: editable installs build from the checkout regardless, and `tools/ratchet_core_window` moves the published window on the release branch at release time.
[validate_sase_core_rs] installed sase-core-rs distribution version 0.32.2 disagrees with the /home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/sase-org/sase/sase_20/sase/repos/linked/sase-core/Cargo.toml checkout version 0.32.3; the checkout moved and the extension was not rebuilt. Run `just install`.
[setup] Note: the sase-core checkout is ahead of the published sase-core-rs window in pyproject.toml; dev installs build from /home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/sase-org/sase/sase_20/sase/repos/linked/sase-core regardless. This is normal — the release-branch reconciler ratchets the published window at release time, so no action is needed here.
[setup] Rebuilding stale or missing sase_core_rs from /home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/sase-org/sase/sase_20/sase/repos/linked/sase-core before Python dependency resolution.

This is normal — the release-branch reconciler ratchets the published window at release time, so no action is needed here.
# Harden cargo crate downloads against transient crates.io flakiness.
# CI has hit `curl ... [16] Error in the HTTP2 framing layer` while
# maturin's `cargo metadata` fetches deps; disabling HTTP/2 multiplexing
# and raising the retry count makes the download resilient. Both are
# overridable from the environment.
