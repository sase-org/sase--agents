## Your next action

The approved plan 202608/ace_completion_convergence.md is implemented in this workspace. just check already passed. You are resuming after just check-full.

If check-full failed: fix the reported failures (keep the plan scope), re-run just check, and if the tree still needs check-full, hand it to /sase_monitor again. Do not declare success until verification is green.

If check-full passed: do not change more files. Use /sase_final as the last action, then reply to the user summarizing what landed: (1) ArtifactWatcher.ensure_watches/prune_agent_dir_watches plus reverse index and watch lock, (2) roster-driven live watch re-arm after agents load, (3) completion notifications as unconditional exact deltas (raw_suffix fallback, tab-gated broad only), (4) write_done_marker pulse parity, (5) exact child-delta merge remirrors tale roots because load_artifact_delta_agents keeps orphaned family follow-ups. Mention that live ACE hot-restart/inotify confirmation from the plan verification section was not run in-agent.
