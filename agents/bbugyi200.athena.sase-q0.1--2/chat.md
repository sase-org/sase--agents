Can you complete the work for bead sase-q0.1? The bead is already reserved for you and assigned to your agent
name: it was set to status=in_progress before you started reading this, either by the `sase bead work` launch
checkpoint or by the runtime promoting an ad-hoc wait-time claim. Do not set the status by hand. Read its
description and design file, do the work, and close only this bead with
`sase bead close sase-q0.1 --note "<what you verified>"`. Before closing, run
`sase bead epic-symbols sase-q0.1`. If this phase still has `--epic-symbol` entries, resolve each symbol or
re-key the Justfile line to a still-open bead (the parent epic or a later phase). `sase bead close` refuses while
leftovers remain; they go stale the instant this phase closes and turn unrelated agents' `just check` red. Closing
an assigned phase bead is unaffected by the parent-close descendant guard. Do NOT close the parent epic or any ancestor plan bead. Any instruction in a phase
description or child plan to close an ancestor is preparation and evidence for that ancestor's land agent, not
authorization for a phase worker. Do not create beads yourself: record discovered follow-up work as a
`PROPOSED FOLLOW-UP:` entry via
`sase bead note sase-q0.1 'PROPOSED FOLLOW-UP: <one-line summary — detail>'`; the epic's land agent triages
these into task beads.

# Monitor handoff

This agent delegated the remaining work to a monitor shell.
Monitor ID: tns5qeb6mrtc
Inspect with: sase monitor show tns5qeb6mrtc
Monitor shell: sase-q0.1--mon
Directory: /home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/sase-org/sase/sase_17

Command:

```sh
just check
```

Reason:

Verify sase-q0.1 ledger phase changes before closing the bead

Next action:

This is agent working sase-q0.1 (Durable RUNNING-field mutation ledger, epic sase-q0). Report pass/fail of `just check`. If it fails only on the pre-existing unrelated mypy error in src/sase/glossary/render.py ("Argument \"color_system\" to \"Console\" has incompatible type"), treat check as passing for this phase (it is unrelated pre-existing breakage, confirmed present on master before this phase's changes). If any test in the scoped run fails, identify which test and whether it relates to sase.running_field, sase.logs.workspace_claim_ledger, or these changed files: src/sase/agent/launch_executor_workspace.py, src/sase/agent/launch_spawn.py, src/sase/axe/run_agent_phases.py, src/sase/axe/run_agent_runner_lifecycle.py, src/sase/ace/scheduler/stale_running_cleanup.py, src/sase/ace/tui/actions/agents/_dismiss_persistence.py, tests/test_running_field_operations.py, tests/logs/test_workspace_claim_ledger.py, tests/test_axe_run_agent_runner_deferred_workspace_claim.py, tests/test_stale_running_cleanup.py, tests/test_run_agent_runner_lifecycle.py — fix those if broken. Then: run `sase bead epic-symbols sase-q0.1` and resolve any leftover --epic-symbol entries by re-keying to a still-open bead (parent epic sase-q0 or a later phase), then close only sase-q0.1 with `sase bead close sase-q0.1 --note "<what you verified>"`. Do NOT close the parent epic sase-q0 or any ancestor. Record any discovered follow-up (including the pre-existing unrelated mypy failure in glossary/render.py, and the pre-existing tests/_agent_cleanup_proc_helpers.py ModuleNotFoundError for sase.ace.tui.proc_queue when tests/test_agent_dismiss_persistence.py is collected standalone) as PROPOSED FOLLOW-UP notes via `sase bead note sase-q0.1 'PROPOSED FOLLOW-UP: ...'` rather than creating beads directly.

## Your next action

This is agent working sase-q0.1. Report pass/fail of `just test-scoped`. If it fails, identify which test and whether it relates to sase.running_field, sase.logs.workspace_claim_ledger, or these changed files: src/sase/agent/launch_executor_workspace.py, src/sase/agent/launch_spawn.py, src/sase/axe/run_agent_phases.py, src/sase/axe/run_agent_runner_lifecycle.py, src/sase/ace/scheduler/stale_running_cleanup.py, src/sase/ace/tui/actions/agents/_dismiss_persistence.py, tests/test_running_field_operations.py, tests/logs/test_workspace_claim_ledger.py, tests/test_axe_run_agent_runner_deferred_workspace_claim.py, tests/test_stale_running_cleanup.py, tests/test_run_agent_runner_lifecycle.py -- fix those if broken. If it passes cleanly (or fails only on pre-existing unrelated issues unrelated to these files), then: run `sase bead epic-symbols sase-q0.1` and resolve any leftover --epic-symbol entries by re-keying to a still-open bead (parent epic sase-q0 or a later phase), then close only sase-q0.1 with `sase bead close sase-q0.1 --note "<what you verified>"`. Do NOT close the parent epic sase-q0 or any ancestor. Record discovered follow-up (including the pre-existing mypy failure in glossary/render.py:74, and the pre-existing tests/_agent_cleanup_proc_helpers.py ModuleNotFoundError for sase.ace.tui.proc_queue when tests/test_agent_dismiss_persistence.py is collected standalone) as PROPOSED FOLLOW-UP notes via `sase bead note sase-q0.1 "PROPOSED FOLLOW-UP: ..."` rather than creating beads directly.
%xprompts_enabled:true

## Response

`just test-scoped` passed cleanly (7531 passed, 4 skipped, 0 failed) — no failures at all, let alone in the changed files. Combined with the earlier `just check` run (which only failed on the pre-existing unrelated mypy error in `glossary/render.py:74`), this phase's changes are verified. Now checking for leftover epic-symbol entries before closing.

No leftover epic-symbols to resolve. Recording the two pre-existing follow-ups as notes, then closing the bead.

Bead sase-q0.1 is closed. Summary: `just check` passed except for the pre-existing unrelated mypy error in `glossary/render.py:74`; `just test-scoped` ran fully clean (7531 passed, 4 skipped, 0 failed) with no failures touching the ledger phase's changed files. No leftover `--epic-symbol` entries existed. Two pre-existing, unrelated issues (the mypy error and a proc_queue `ModuleNotFoundError` on standalone test collection) were recorded as `PROPOSED FOLLOW-UP` notes for the epic's land agent to triage. The parent epic sase-q0 was left untouched, as instructed.

I'll check the current state first — bead status and git status — before acting on the finalizer's instructions.

The bead is already closed locally. Let me verify the close was actually published before committing, per the finalizer's instructions.

The close command returned cleanly (exit 0, no "NOT published" error), confirming it's already published — good. Now committing the changes via the git commit skill.

I have enough context. Writing the commit message now.

The commit command is running in the background — I'll wait for it to finish rather than poll manually.

The background commit task completed successfully. Let me check the output and verify the final state.

The commit succeeded and pushed cleanly — branch is in sync with `origin/master`, working tree clean. The pre-commit hook also picked up an unrelated pre-existing mypy fix (`959d205ca fix(glossary): narrow Console.color_system for mypy`) that landed from elsewhere between pulls.

Summary: bead sase-q0.1 (durable RUNNING-field mutation ledger) was already closed and verified published. Committed and pushed the ledger implementation (`src/sase/logs/workspace_claim_ledger.py` + call sites in `running_field/_operations.py`, launch/axe callers, and stale-cleanup) as `725cdb11d feat(running-field): record every workspace claim mutation to a durable ledger`. The one warning — 30 quarantined agent-hood publication requests, unrelated to this commit — doesn't block anything; `sase agent sync --retry-quarantined` would clear it if needed.
