[validate_sase_core_rs_version] sase-core checkout is ahead of sase's compatibility window: source version 0.32.2 from /home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/sase-org/sase/sase_25/sase/repos/linked/sase-core/Cargo.toml does not satisfy `sase`'s `sase-core-rs>=0.31.12,<0.32.0` dependency in pyproject.toml. No action is needed: editable installs build from the checkout regardless, and `tools/ratchet_core_window` moves the published window on the release branch at release time.
[setup] Note: the sase-core checkout is ahead of the published sase-core-rs window in pyproject.toml; dev installs build from /home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/sase-org/sase/sase_25/sase/repos/linked/sase-core regardless. This is normal — the release-branch reconciler ratchets the published window at release time, so no action is needed here.

## Your next action

Review just check results for the repair_failed_agent_fork_launch plan implementation (src/sase/axe/run_agent_runner_bootstrap.py, tests/test_axe_run_agent_runner_deferred_workspace_outcomes.py, tests/test_axe_run_agent_failed_fork_admission.py). If green: append the second sase-t8 epic note naming the final implementation (bootstrap.py assertion replaced with conservative admission, new composition regression tests/test_axe_run_agent_failed_fork_admission.py, updated tests/test_axe_run_agent_runner_deferred_workspace_outcomes.py) and test coverage via `sase bead note sase-t8 "..."`, then report completion to the user summarizing the fix, files touched, and verification status per the plans/202608/repair_failed_agent_fork_launch.md completion criteria. If red: diagnose and fix the failure, then rerun just check (inline or via another monitor).
