You are the linker agent for a research swarm. The lead researcher,
`research.3d.final`, has written a consolidated report on the request below. Your job
is to publish that report as the canonical `<name>.md`: the file readers open, and the
one SASE renders into a Highlights PDF. You are an editor, not a researcher. The new
file must carry exactly the lead's meaning and intent. Do not do research of your own:
add no new claims or sources, settle no open questions, and neither soften nor
strengthen the conclusions or the recommendation. If the lead seems wrong, leave it as
written. The only prose you write yourself is the short research-query summary of the
request that opens the file (step 3).

SASE derives your plan's links from the artifacts you read this turn; use
`sase artifact read` for context you actually used.

Research request (context only; do not research it, but summarize it as the file's
research query in step 3):

Traversing through
the "current project" stack using the `<ctrl+n/p>` keymaps can be painfully slow in the
prompt input widget. Also, activating the prompt input widget using the `<space>` keymap
can be pretty slow sometimes too. It is very important that both of these operations are
very fast.

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to make these
keymaps work much faster? End your analysis with a recommended solution.

The lead researcher's registered report:

{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "markdown" and a.label and a.label.startswith("research:") %}
- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} source_path={{ a.source_path }} path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }}
{% endfor %}

The image agent's registered images:

{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "image" %}
- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} vcs_relpath={{ a.vcs_relpath }} path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }}
{% endfor %}

Steps:

1. **Identify the source.** From the registered reports above, find exactly one entry
   with `wait_name` `research.3d.final` whose label has the form
   `research:<YYYYMM>/<name>/<name>__final.md`. If there is not exactly one such entry,
   stop and report the missing or ambiguous input instead of guessing. Open the research
   repo with `/sase_repo`, then read the report through its canonical research reference
   (or the `ref` field's `file:<id>` reference if the original has moved) using
   `sase artifact read`. Take `<YYYYMM>/<name>/` from the label, never from the current
   date. Do not read predecessor chat transcripts. Never modify, move, or delete
   `<name>__final.md` or the drafts.

2. **Inventory what must survive.** Before writing, list every finding, recommendation,
   caveat, open question, confidence statement, number, date, version, code block,
   table, and link in the lead's report.
3. **Restructure** the lead's report into a well-thought-out organization:
   - Keep the frontmatter, updating `updated_time` if present.
   - **Open the file in this exact order**, with nothing else between these parts: the frontmatter (if any), one `#` title, the research query, the infographic, and then the bottom-line section.
   - **Research query.** Directly below the title, add one blockquote that summarizes
     the research request above in one to three sentences, for example
     `> **Research query:** <summary>`. Phrase it as the question or task being
     answered, in the requester's own terms: keep the questions, named subjects, and
     explicit scope or constraints; drop instructions aimed at agents, such as output
     paths, xprompt or directive syntax, and formatting requests. Summarize what was
     asked, not material the request quotes or attaches. Use a request that is already
     one short sentence verbatim. Never fold findings, answers, or scope the request
     does not state into it. It is not a heading, so it gets no section number and no
     TOC entry.
   - **Embed the infographic** exactly once, directly above the bottom-line section:
     after the research query and before that section's `##` heading, never further
     down. Use a relative link with descriptive alt text, for example
     `![<alt text>](<name>_infographic.png)`. Locate it by the
     `<name>_infographic.png` convention or the image entries above. Embed only a file
     you have confirmed exists beside the report in your research checkout. If the
     image agent completed without producing one, publish without it (the research
     query then sits directly above the bottom-line section) and say so in the final
     response.
   - **Bottom-line section.** The first `##` section is `## Bottom line` (or
     `## Overview` when the report surveys options rather than giving one answer) and
     gives the answer first.
   - Below it, `##` and `###` sections ordered by the questions a reader will ask, with
     duplicated passages merged.
   - **Never number headings.** The PDF renderer runs pandoc with `--number-sections`,
     so hand-numbered headings render doubly numbered.
   - **No table of contents and no block of jump links.** The PDF already gets a TOC.
   - Keep the lead's wording where it works. Never drop a claim, caveat, or source to
     save space. If the lead's report restates the question or lists its inputs, keep
     those details in a later section; the research query summarizes the request but
     does not replace them.
4. **Validate every link carried over.**
   - Relative links resolve from `<YYYYMM>/<name>/`, and in-document anchors resolve
     against the final headings. Both are hard requirements.
   - Check external URLs with `curl -fsSL -o /dev/null --max-time 20 <url>`, retrying
     a transient failure once. Treat 401, 403, 429, and timeouts as _unverified_ and
     keep those links.
   - Verify repository-file links through a `/sase_repo` checkout, not by fetching
     github.com.
   - Repair a link only when the right target is certain: a followed redirect, a moved
     file, an obvious typo, or a renamed heading. For an unrepairable link, keep its
     text, drop the dead URL, and list it in the final response. **Never search for a
     replacement source.**

5. **Add in-document links** so readers can jump between parts of the file. Add them
   inline and sparingly: from summary points to the sections that back them, from "see
   above" or "see below" phrases, and from mentions of a named option, phase, or
   finding to where it is discussed. Do not link every mention.
   - Every heading used as a link target must start with a letter, contain only
     letters, digits, spaces, and hyphens, and be unique. Its anchor is then the
     lowercased heading with spaces replaced by hyphens, for example
     `[the bottom line](#bottom-line)`. pandoc (the PDF) and GitHub then agree.
   - Move emoji, version numbers, and code out of such headings, into the section's
     first line.
   - When `pandoc` is available, confirm anchors with `pandoc <file> -t html`.

6. **Re-check against the step-2 inventory** and restore anything missing or changed.
   Every URL in `<name>__final.md` must appear in the new file unless it was listed as
   unrepairable. Then confirm the file opens in the step-3 order: title, research query, infographic, bottom-line section.

7. **Write** `<YYYYMM>/<name>/<name>.md` without overwrite. On a collision, stop and
   report it.

8. **Register** it as a durable snapshot:

   sase artifact create -p "<absolute-report-path>" -l "research:<repo-relative-report-path>"

   Use the report's actual absolute path and its path relative to the research repo
   root, for example `research:202609/<name>/<name>.md`. Use no `--move`. If
   registration fails, report it and do not claim full completion.

## Response

I've read the lead's report and checked the infographic. There's no frontmatter, no URLs, no links, and no code fences, and the target file doesn't exist yet. Next I'll write the restructured file.

Only a line-wrap artifact in my grep. Checking the wrapped IDs directly:

The report is registered. Now the final declaration.

I published the lead's report as the canonical file and registered it.

**File:** `202610/prompt_space_and_project_cycle_latency/prompt_space_and_project_cycle_latency.md`, registered as `research:202610/prompt_space_and_project_cycle_latency/prompt_space_and_project_cycle_latency.md` (`file:explicit:a532b36ee8b3d921d4318474`). I didn't touch `__final.md` or the drafts. The research repo commit is declared and the host will make it after this turn.

**Opening order:** the title, then a one-blockquote research query, then the infographic (`prompt_space_and_project_cycle_latency_infographic.png`, which exists beside the report), then `## Bottom line`. The report has no frontmatter, so there was no `updated_time` to update.

**New structure:**
1. Bottom line
2. What the keys actually do
3. Where the time goes: measurements, live incidents, root-cause mechanics, and the cross-cutting stall budget and GC
4. Recommended solution: Phase 1, Phase 2, and the separate stall-budget track
5. Acceptance targets and guardrails
6. Risks
7. Options considered
8. Disagreements and how the lead resolved them
9. Sources and evidence

The lead's metadata line, list of inputs and evidence-provenance table moved into that last section. No headings are numbered and there's no table of contents.

**What I changed in the text:**
- **Cross-references:** I replaced the `§N` references (§6, §3.3, §3.4, "Phase 1 step 6") with in-document anchor links. I also added a few links from the bottom line to the sections that back it, including Phase 1, Phase 2 and the separate track.
- **Headings:** I removed colons, punctuation and code from the headings. The dropped words became each section's first line, such as "my additions", "today's stall-watchdog rows", `<space>`, "behind 'sometimes'" and "merged from the five reports".
- **Rules:** I dropped the two `---` horizontal rules.

**Checks:**
- **Links:** the lead's report has no external URLs, so none needed curl checks and none were unrepairable. The only relative link is the infographic.
- **Anchors:** `pandoc -t html` confirms every in-document link resolves, and no heading IDs are duplicated.
- **Content:** a token comparison against `__final.md` found every claim, number, table, caveat and source carried over. The only text dropped was the section numbers, the `---` rules, and heading wording I reworded or moved into section first lines.
