%clan(research.5j, tribe=research, summary=[[[bold]RESEARCH PROMPT:[/bold] Why did the `16h.f0` sase agent start before the `16h` sase agent finished its work? The
`16h.f0` sase agent had `fork:16h` in its prompt so I was expecting it to wait for the
`16h` sase agent to complete before starting. With that said, since we have the ability
to specify that coder agents wait for another agent (in the coder options for a tale's
gate in the TUI, for example), it would be useful to be able to specifify whether an
agent should target the agent session or the currently running turn for that agent (this
seems to be what the `16h.f0` sase agent targeted).

- We could implement this with a new `target=<target>` input on the `fork` macro.
- The `<target>` input value would be required to be either "session" or "turn" (with a
  default of "session"). We should enforce this using an enum macro input type (this is
  the same type we use for inputs that accept model names I believe).

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a
different approach? Make any adjustments to the requirements that you think are
justified but clearly call these out. End your analysis with a recommended solution.]]) %id:research.5j.final %m:@xlarge

You are the lead researcher: 5 independent researchers have reported on the request
below, and you will add your own research and merge every perspective into one
consolidated report.

SASE derives your plan's links from the artifacts you read this turn; use
`sase artifact read` for context you actually used.

When you author or carry over Mermaid diagrams, load `/mermaid_diagrams` before
drafting, even when no image or diagrams companion runs. The skill has the shared
figure-selection, styling, and PDF-render review rules. If the provider skill is not
deployed, verify the edited plugin's guide with `sase macro show skill/mermaid_diagrams --format raw` (or
`sase macro show /mermaid_diagrams --format raw`) and use the form this host supports.
This guidance does not enable a companion diagrams agent.

The researchers' registered reports:

{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "markdown" and a.label and a.label.startswith("research:") %}
- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} source_path={{ a.source_path }} path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }}
{% endfor %}

Month directory (create it if missing):

$(sase repo path research --ensure)/$(date +%Y%m)

Steps:

1. From the registered reports above, identify exactly one report per expected suffix
   in cdx, cld, grk, mus, gem, belonging to this
   dispatch's `research.5j.cdx`, `research.5j.cld`, `research.5j.grk`, `research.5j.mus`, `research.5j.gem` dependencies, matching by `wait_name` and the canonical research
   label's existing `__<suffix>.md` suffix. Never reassign suffixes from list order.
   Open the research repo with `/sase_repo`, then read each report through its canonical
   research reference (or the `ref` field's `file:<id>` reference if the original has
   moved) using `sase artifact read`. Do not read predecessor chat transcripts. If the
   records above do not identify exactly one report per expected suffix, stop and report
   the missing or ambiguous input instead of guessing.
2. Research the request yourself, prioritizing gaps, weak evidence, and disagreements
   between the reports.
3. Pick a descriptive stem `<name>` that collides with nothing in the month directory
   (do NOT end the name with `_consolidated` or `_<YYYYmmdd>` or anything similar unless
   it relates to the research topic), create `<month-dir>/<name>/`, and move each report
   inside it as `<name>__<suffix>.md`, preserving its existing suffix. Each report's
   `source_path` is provenance for where it lives in your own opened research checkout;
   resolve its canonical repo-relative path there before moving it. Never modify the
   other agents' checkouts or the stored snapshot recorded at `ref` — only the copy in
   your own checkout moves. Preserve every file and never overwrite: on any collision,
   pick a different stem first.
4. Write the consolidated report to `<name>/<name>__final.md`: merge the strongest findings
   from every report above and your own research, resolve conflicts, cut duplication,
   and add missing critical context without unnecessary length.

   Do not create `<name>/<name>.md`, not even as a placeholder, because the linker
   agent `research.5j.linker` publishes it from your report.

5. After the write succeeds, register the consolidated report as a durable snapshot so
   the linker agent, `research.5j.linker`, can find it:

   sase artifact create -p "<absolute-report-path>" -l "research:<repo-relative-report-path>"

   Use the consolidated report's actual absolute path and its path relative to the
   research repo root, for example `research:202609/<name>/<name>__final.md`. Register
   only the consolidated report, and do not pass `--move`. If registration fails,
   report that failure; do not report the task as fully complete.
