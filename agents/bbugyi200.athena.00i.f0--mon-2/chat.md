## Response

[validate_sase_core_rs_version] sase-core checkout is ahead of sase's compatibility window: source version 0.27.1 from /home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/sase-org/sase/sase_10/sase/repos/linked/sase-core/Cargo.toml does not satisfy `sase`'s `sase-core-rs>=0.26.10,<0.27.0` dependency in pyproject.toml. No action is needed: editable installs build from the checkout regardless, and `tools/ratchet_core_window` moves the published window on the release branch at release time.
[setup] Note: the sase-core checkout is ahead of the published sase-core-rs window in pyproject.toml; dev installs build from /home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/sase-org/sase/sase_10/sase/repos/linked/sase-core regardless. This is normal — the release-branch reconciler ratchets the published window at release time, so no action is needed here.
