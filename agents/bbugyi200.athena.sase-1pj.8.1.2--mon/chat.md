# Harden cargo crate downloads against transient crates.io flakiness.
# CI has hit `curl ... [16] Error in the HTTP2 framing layer` while
# maturin's `cargo metadata` fetches deps; disabling HTTP/2 multiplexing
# and raising the retry count makes the download resilient. Both are
# overridable from the environment.
# Capture the source identity after the checkout refresh above and before
# the build below. It is written to the venv only after a successful
# install (wheel-cache hit or `maturin develop` alike), so an edit made
# during the build still reads as stale on the next check.
