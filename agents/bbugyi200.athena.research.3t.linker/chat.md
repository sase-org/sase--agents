You are the linker agent for a research swarm. The lead researcher,
`research.3t.final`, has written a consolidated report on the request below. Your job
is to publish that report as the canonical `<name>.md`: the file readers open, and the
one SASE renders into a Highlights PDF. You are an editor, not a researcher. The new
file must carry exactly the lead's meaning and intent. Do not do research of your own:
add no new claims or sources, settle no open questions, and neither soften nor
strengthen the conclusions or the recommendation. If the lead seems wrong, leave it as
written. The only prose you write yourself is the short research-query summary of the
request that opens the file (step 3).

SASE derives your plan's links from the artifacts you read this turn; use
`sase artifact read` for context you actually used.

Research request (context only; do not research it, but summarize it as the file's
research query in step 3):

I'm looking for some recent (published within the last year) articles that will further
inspire my work on goals. We've done some related research to find good articles (and
papers, which I'm fine with this round too but I will preference articles) that help
with this (find this research file in the research sidecar repo), but I'm looking for
more that will inspire me.

Can you do some research with the goal of finding the articles that are most likely to
do that? End your analysis with a ranked list of articles that you think I should
consider reading.

The lead researcher's registered report:

{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "markdown" and a.label and a.label.startswith("research:") %}
- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} source_path={{ a.source_path }} path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }}
{% endfor %}

The image agent's registered images:

{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "image" %}
- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} vcs_relpath={{ a.vcs_relpath }} path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }}
{% endfor %}


The audio agent's narrated edition:

{% if agents is defined %}{% for key, outputs in agents.items() if outputs.audio is defined %}
- agent={{ key }} audio={{ outputs.audio }}
{% endfor %}{% endif %}
{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "file" and a.label and a.label.startswith("audio:") %}
- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }}
{% endfor %}

Steps:

1. **Identify the source.** From the registered reports above, find exactly one entry
   with `wait_name` `research.3t.final` whose label has the form
   `research:<YYYYMM>/<name>/<name>__final.md`. If there is not exactly one such entry,
   stop and report the missing or ambiguous input instead of guessing. Open the research
   repo with `/sase_repo`, then read the report through its canonical research reference
   (or the `ref` field's `file:<id>` reference if the original has moved) using
   `sase artifact read`. Take `<YYYYMM>/<name>/` from the label, never from the current
   date. Do not read predecessor chat transcripts. Never modify, move, or delete
   `<name>__final.md` or the drafts.

2. **Inventory what must survive.** Before writing, list every finding, recommendation,
   caveat, open question, confidence statement, number, date, version, code block,
   table, and link in the lead's report.
3. **Restructure** the lead's report into a well-thought-out organization:
   - Keep the frontmatter, updating `updated_time` if present.
   - **Open the file in this exact order**, with nothing else between these parts: the frontmatter (if any), one `#` title, the research query, the listen card, the infographic, and then the bottom-line section.
   - **Research query.** Directly below the title, add one blockquote that summarizes
     the research request above in one to three sentences, for example
     `> **Research query:** <summary>`. Phrase it as the question or task being
     answered, in the requester's own terms: keep the questions, named subjects, and
     explicit scope or constraints; drop instructions aimed at agents, such as output
     paths, macro or directive syntax, and formatting requests. Summarize what was
     asked, not material the request quotes or attaches. Use a request that is already
     one short sentence verbatim. Never fold findings, answers, or scope the request
     does not state into it. It is not a heading, so it gets no section number and no
     TOC entry.
   - **Listen card.** Facts come from the `audio` variable of `research.3t.audio`
     when `ok` is true. If the variable is missing but an `audio:<episode_id>`
     artifact is listed, recover the facts with `sase-listen ls <episode_id> --json`
     (or `uvx sase-listen …`): `audio.duration_s`, chapter count, `script.edition`.
     If `ok` is false or nothing is listed, publish with no card and no `audio:`
     frontmatter, and say so in the final response (never write "audio pending").
     Add this frontmatter mapping (create a frontmatter block if the lead's report
     has none), copying numbers verbatim, never inventing them:

     ```yaml
     audio:
       edition: brief
       duration_s: 250.34
       chapter_count: 3
       episode_id: a-listen-link-for-research-reports-d74298
     ```

     No library path, MP3 path, feed URL, artifact id, or `file:` ref — the research
     repo is public. Insert the card exactly once, directly below the research-query
     blockquote and above the infographic, with the blank lines shown (they make
     GitHub and pandoc parse the inner Markdown):

     ```markdown
     <div class="listen">

     ♫ **Brief audio edition** · 4 min · 3 chapters · [Narration
     script](<name>_narration.md)

     </div>
     ```

     Rules: edition word capitalized (`Brief` / `Full`); minutes =
     `max(1, round(duration_s / 60))`; `1 chapter` singular; drop the chapters
     segment if the count is unknown; include the script segment only when
     `<name>_narration.md` exists beside the report in the research checkout;
     nothing else inside the div; not a heading; not inside the blockquote; never
     a link to an MP3, library path, feed URL, or `highlights://` URI.
   - **Embed the infographic** exactly once, directly above the bottom-line section:
     after the listen card and before that section's `##` heading, never further
     down. Use a relative link with descriptive alt text, for example
     `![<alt text>](<name>_infographic.png)`. Locate it by the
     `<name>_infographic.png` convention or the image entries above. Embed only a file
     you have confirmed exists beside the report in your research checkout. If the
     image agent completed without producing one, publish without it (the listen
     card then sits directly above the bottom-line section) and say so in the final
     response.
   - **Bottom-line section.** The first `##` section is `## Bottom line` (or
     `## Overview` when the report surveys options rather than giving one answer) and
     gives the answer first.
   - Below it, `##` and `###` sections ordered by the questions a reader will ask, with
     duplicated passages merged.
   - **Never number headings.** The PDF renderer runs pandoc with `--number-sections`,
     so hand-numbered headings render doubly numbered.
   - **No table of contents and no block of jump links.** The PDF already gets a TOC.
   - Keep the lead's wording where it works. Never drop a claim, caveat, or source to
     save space. If the lead's report restates the question or lists its inputs, keep
     those details in a later section; the research query summarizes the request but
     does not replace them.
4. **Validate every link carried over.**
   - Relative links resolve from `<YYYYMM>/<name>/`, and in-document anchors resolve
     against the final headings. Both are hard requirements.
   - Check external URLs with `curl -fsSL -o /dev/null --max-time 20 <url>`, retrying
     a transient failure once. Treat 401, 403, 429, and timeouts as _unverified_ and
     keep those links.
   - Verify repository-file links through a `/sase_repo` checkout, not by fetching
     github.com.
   - Repair a link only when the right target is certain: a followed redirect, a moved
     file, an obvious typo, or a renamed heading. For an unrepairable link, keep its
     text, drop the dead URL, and list it in the final response. **Never search for a
     replacement source.**

5. **Add in-document links** so readers can jump between parts of the file. Add them
   inline and sparingly: from summary points to the sections that back them, from "see
   above" or "see below" phrases, and from mentions of a named option, phase, or
   finding to where it is discussed. Do not link every mention.
   - Every heading used as a link target must start with a letter, contain only
     letters, digits, spaces, and hyphens, and be unique. Its anchor is then the
     lowercased heading with spaces replaced by hyphens, for example
     `[the bottom line](#bottom-line)`. pandoc (the PDF) and GitHub then agree.
   - Move emoji, version numbers, and code out of such headings, into the section's
     first line.
   - When `pandoc` is available, confirm anchors with `pandoc <file> -t html`.

6. **Re-check against the step-2 inventory** and restore anything missing or changed.
   Every URL in `<name>__final.md` must appear in the new file unless it was listed as
   unrepairable. Then confirm the file opens in the step-3 order: title, research query, listen card, infographic, bottom-line section.

7. **Write** `<YYYYMM>/<name>/<name>.md` without overwrite. On a collision, stop and
   report it.

8. **Register** it as a durable snapshot:

   sase artifact create -p "<absolute-report-path>" -l "research:<repo-relative-report-path>"

   Use the report's actual absolute path and its path relative to the research repo
   root, for example `research:202609/<name>/<name>.md`. Use no `--move`. If
   registration fails, report it and do not claim full completion.

## Response

Reading the lead's report is done; next I'll inventory its links and check them before writing the canonical file.

I've written the file. Now I'm checking its anchors with pandoc and comparing it against the lead's content.

Registration worked. Now I'm submitting the final declaration, which commits the new file in the research repo.

I published the lead's report as `202610/goals_inspiration_round_two_reading_list/goals_inspiration_round_two_reading_list.md` and registered it as `file:explicit:08fd55f32441babef3e8c327`. The research-repo commit is declared; the host makes it after this turn ends.

- **Opening order:** the file starts with the frontmatter, then the title, the research query, the listen card, the infographic, and `## Bottom line`. The lead's report had no frontmatter, so I created one holding only the `audio:` mapping: brief edition, `duration_s: 274.5`, 3 chapters, episode `twelve-more-readings-to-inspire-sase-goals-round-two-64b1ee`. The card reads "5 min · 3 chapters" and links the narration script. Both the infographic and the narration file are in the report's directory.
- **Content:** a word-by-word diff against `__final.md` shows nothing was dropped. The only differences are the changes below, the new research query, and a few short "see …" links.
- **Restructuring:** the lead's "Date / Builds on / Inputs" bullets moved to a new "Scope and inputs" section near the end. I grouped "Five ideas" with the goals-area table, and "Already in your research" with "Considered and not ranked". "Gaps that remain" moved up, ahead of the method sections.
- **Heading changes:** the twelve rank headings had commas, periods, quotes and `+`, which pandoc and GitHub turn into mismatched anchors. Each is now "Rank N - Title", for example "Rank 9 - Proven to Work and Showboat". The author names and full titles from the old headings now sit in each section's opening bullets. I updated every in-document link to the new anchors.
- **Link checks:** all 42 external URLs from the lead's report are carried over and returned 200. The DOI link redirects to nature.com and I kept the DOI. All 9 relative links resolve, all 15 in-document anchors resolve, and pandoc's markdown and GFM readers produce the same heading IDs. No links were unrepairable and none were replaced.

Nothing was missing: the listen card and infographic are both included, and there was no file-name collision.
