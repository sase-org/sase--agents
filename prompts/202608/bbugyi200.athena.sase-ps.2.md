[validate_sase_core_rs_version] sase-core checkout is ahead of sase's compatibility window: source version 0.28.0 from /home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/sase-org/sase/sase_16/sase/repos/linked/sase-core/Cargo.toml does not satisfy `sase`'s `sase-core-rs>=0.27.18,<0.28.0` dependency in pyproject.toml. No action is needed: editable installs build from the checkout regardless, and `tools/ratchet_core_window` moves the published window on the release branch at release time.
[setup] Note: the sase-core checkout is ahead of the published sase-core-rs window in pyproject.toml; dev installs build from /home/bryan/.local/state/sase/workspaces/sase-org/sase/sase_16/sase/repos/linked/sase-core regardless. This is normal — the release-branch reconciler ratchets the published window at release time, so no action is needed here.

## Your next action

Report just check results for sase-ps.2 (Occupancy parity across ACE and agent
listings); if clean, run `sase bead epic-symbols sase-ps.2` (expect none) and then close
the bead with `sase bead close sase-ps.2 --note "<summary of what was verified>"`; if it
fails, diagnose and fix the failure, then rerun just check. %xprompts_enabled:true
