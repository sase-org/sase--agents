%clan(research.2w, tribe=research, summary=[[[bold]RESEARCH PROMPT:[/bold] I want to add
excellent support for bead file attachments.

- We already support leaving notes of the form `@<path_to_file>` as long as
  `@<path_to_file>` is the only contents of the note.
- We should add support for `@<path_to_file>` references anywhere in a note and require
  that `@@` be used if a literal `@` is needed.
- We should have robust (but optional--not all users will necessarily run the
  `sase bead show` command using a terminal that supports viewing images, for
  example--also I'm not sure that sase agents will want this enabled since it might be
  easier for them to use image file paths to read images directly) support for viewing
  images
- Finally, make sure that large and arbitrary binary files are supported. Think hard
  about the best way to add support for these.

#gh:gh_sase-org__sase You are the lead researcher: 5 independent researchers have
reported on the request below, and you will add your own research and merge every
perspective into one consolidated report.

SASE derives your plan's links from the artifacts you read this turn; use
`sase artifact read` for context you actually used.

The researchers' registered reports:

{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "markdown" and a.label and a.label.startswith("research:") %}

- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} source_path={{ a.source_path }}
  path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }} {% endfor %}

Month directory (create it if missing):

$(sase repo path research --ensure)/$(date +%Y%m)

Steps:

1. From the registered reports above, identify exactly one report per expected suffix in
   cdx, cld, grk, mus, gem, belonging to this dispatch's `research.2w.cdx`,
   `research.2w.cld`, `research.2w.grk`, `research.2w.mus`, `research.2w.gem`
   dependencies, matching by `wait_name` and the canonical research label's existing
   `__<suffix>.md` suffix. Never reassign suffixes from list order. Open the research
   repo with `/sase_repo`, then read each report through its canonical research
   reference (or the `ref` field's `file:<id>` reference if the original has moved)
   using `sase artifact read`. Do not read predecessor chat transcripts. If the records
   above do not identify exactly one report per expected suffix, stop and report the
   missing or ambiguous input instead of guessing.
2. Research the request yourself, prioritizing gaps, weak evidence, and disagreements
   between the reports.
3. Pick a descriptive stem `<name>` that collides with nothing in the month directory
   (do NOT end the name with `_consolidated` or `_<YYYYmmdd>` or anything similar unless
   it relates to the research topic), create `<month-dir>/<name>/`, and move each report
   inside it as `<name>__<suffix>.md`, preserving its existing suffix. Each report's
   `source_path` is provenance for where it lives in your own opened research checkout;
   resolve its canonical repo-relative path there before moving it. Never modify the
   other agents' checkouts or the stored snapshot recorded at `ref` — only the copy in
   your own checkout moves. Preserve every file and never overwrite: on any collision,
   pick a different stem first.
4. Write the consolidated report to `<name>/<name>.md`: merge the strongest findings
   from every report above and your own research, resolve conflicts, cut duplication,
   and add missing critical context without unnecessary length.

Final layout:

```text
<month-dir>/<name>/
├── <name>__cdx.md
├── <name>__cld.md
├── <name>__grk.md
├── <name>__mus.md
├── <name>__gem.md
└── <name>.md
