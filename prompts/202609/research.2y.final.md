store too many prompts in prompt history (see the ~/tmp/screenshots/20260930_062115.png
screenshot for an example of a prompt that likely shouldn't have been stored).

- Namely, prompt history is meant to be used to store user prompts, each of which is
  supposed to correlate with a specific request made by a human being (by using the
  prompt input widget in the TUI or the `sase run` command to launch a sase agent, for
  example).
- Any prompt used to launch agents that belong to an xprompt swarm should not be saved
  to prompt history, but the prompt containing the xprompt swarm invokation
  (`#research_swarm`, for example) which was used by the user to launch the swarm should
  be saved to prompt history.
- Any prompt used to launch agents from routines should not be saved to prompt history.

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a
different approach? Make any adjustments to the requirements that you think are
justified but clearly call these out. End your analysis with a recommended solution.]])

#gh:gh_sase-org__sase You are the lead researcher: 5 independent researchers have
reported on the request below, and you will add your own research and merge every
perspective into one consolidated report.

SASE derives your plan's links from the artifacts you read this turn; use
`sase artifact read` for context you actually used.

The researchers' registered reports:

{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "markdown" and a.label and a.label.startswith("research:") %}

- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} source_path={{ a.source_path }}
  path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }} {% endfor %}

Month directory (create it if missing):

$(sase repo path research --ensure)/$(date +%Y%m)

Steps:

1. From the registered reports above, identify exactly one report per expected suffix in
   cdx, cld, grk, mus, gem, belonging to this dispatch's `research.2y.cdx`,
   `research.2y.cld`, `research.2y.grk`, `research.2y.mus`, `research.2y.gem`
   dependencies, matching by `wait_name` and the canonical research label's existing
   `__<suffix>.md` suffix. Never reassign suffixes from list order. Open the research
   repo with `/sase_repo`, then read each report through its canonical research
   reference (or the `ref` field's `file:<id>` reference if the original has moved)
   using `sase artifact read`. Do not read predecessor chat transcripts. If the records
   above do not identify exactly one report per expected suffix, stop and report the
   missing or ambiguous input instead of guessing.
2. Research the request yourself, prioritizing gaps, weak evidence, and disagreements
   between the reports.
3. Pick a descriptive stem `<name>` that collides with nothing in the month directory
   (do NOT end the name with `_consolidated` or `_<YYYYmmdd>` or anything similar unless
   it relates to the research topic), create `<month-dir>/<name>/`, and move each report
   inside it as `<name>__<suffix>.md`, preserving its existing suffix. Each report's
   `source_path` is provenance for where it lives in your own opened research checkout;
   resolve its canonical repo-relative path there before moving it. Never modify the
   other agents' checkouts or the stored snapshot recorded at `ref` — only the copy in
   your own checkout moves. Preserve every file and never overwrite: on any collision,
   pick a different stem first.
4. Write the consolidated report to `<name>/<name>.md`: merge the strongest findings
   from every report above and your own research, resolve conflicts, cut duplication,
   and add missing critical context without unnecessary length.
