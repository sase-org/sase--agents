You are researcher cdx in a 4-researcher swarm. The other researchers,
`research.2m.grk`, `research.2m.mus`, `research.2m.gem`, are independently investigating
the same request and will write their own self-named reports ending in `__grk.md` and
`__mus.md` and `__gem.md`. Your report will end in `__cdx.md`.

Conduct your research independently and form your own conclusions. Do NOT attempt to
locate, open, read, or otherwise consult the other researcher's report from this swarm,
even if it becomes available before you finish. Do not obtain that peer's findings
indirectly through its chat transcript, summaries, or requests to the peer. You may
independently use the same external sources, shared input material, and unrelated prior
research. You may check filenames or file existence to avoid overwriting your own
output, but do not inspect the peer's report contents. If you encounter its filename,
leave the report alone. The lead researcher will read every report and synthesize their
findings after you have all finished.

I want to add a new "Goals" functionality to sase.

- Goals should be associated with the original prompts that were used to launch the sase
  agent that created the goal.
- All sase agents MUST have a goal defined.
  - We already support a required `goal` field for tale / epic plans, so these should be
    used as an agent's goal whenever a plan file is associated with that agent.
  - Any sase agent that does not have a goal associated with it implicitly through a
    plan should be required to create a new goal or, ideally, link to an existing active
    goal.
  - One idea for implementing this would be to require that every sase agent that is NOT
    tasked with creating a plan using the /sase_plan skill (i.e. planner agents don't
    need to do this) check if the `SASE_PLAN` environment variable is set at the start
    of EVERY conversation. If not, it could invoke a new /sase_new_goal xprompt skill.
    This is just one thought, though. Think hard about the best way to solve this.
  - An example goal for an agent without an associated plan that couldn't find a related
    goal to link to might be to answer a user question.
- We should use a new finalizer that requires sase agents to explicitly decide whether
  or not to close the goal or leave it open. An agent that chooses to close a goal must
  provide evidence to the finalizer (that will then be linked to the goal somehow before
  closing it). Think hard about what we should require this evidence to be.
- The TUI should have a new "Goals" panel somewhere that users can use to see all active
  goals for a project. We should use artifact links to make it very easy for users to
  jump from this panel to any artifact and/or sase agent on the "Agents" tab linked to
  that goal.
- One motivation for this change is to start using newly done goals to notify me that I
  need to verify something. I currently use agent completion notifications for this,
  either directly or via the unread indicators on the agent tab. The problem with that
  approach is that not every agent that completes needs my attention like this (I really
  only need to be alerted when my agents claims that a goal which was set is now
  complete).
- The above requirements imply that sase agents need access to all active goals (really,
  any human/agent working on a sase project from any machine needs this access). This
  access needs to be lightning fast. More specifically, we should aim for `O(n)`
  performance, where `n` is the number of active goals (so done goals have no effect on
  performance).

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a
different approach? Make any adjustments to the requirements that you think are
justified but clearly call these out. End your analysis with a recommended solution.
