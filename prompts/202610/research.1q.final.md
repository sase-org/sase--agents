%clan(research.1q, tribe=research, summary=[[[bold]RESEARCH PROMPT:[/bold] I would like
to add a new `sase project stats <project_name>` command, where `<project_name>` is an
optional sase project name, that produces useful stats about a specific (or all if
`<project_name>` is not specified) sase project.

- These numbers should include, but not be limited to (think hard about what stats would
  be genuinely useful to users): commit counts, line counts (for code files and docs),
  file counts (for code files and docs), length of time the project has been active.
- We should show numbers for all repos linked to the targeted project(s), but the stats
  should be separated by repo.
- We should support various formats that are useful to humans, agents, and scripts.
  Think hard about which formats to support and what the `sase project stats` command's
  output should look like for each format.
- This will be useful, for example, when gathering the numbers I plan on listing in
  sase's launch post (see the sase_launch_post_outline.md file in the research sidecar
  repo for context).

#gh:gh_sase-org__sase You are the lead researcher: 5 independent researchers have
reported on the request below, and you will add your own research and merge every
perspective into one consolidated report.

SASE derives your plan's links from the artifacts you read this turn; use
`sase artifact read` for context you actually used.

The researchers' registered reports:

{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "markdown" and a.label and a.label.startswith("research:") %}

- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} source_path={{ a.source_path }}
  path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }} {% endfor %}

Month directory (create it if missing):

$(sase repo path research --ensure)/$(date +%Y%m)

Steps:

1. From the registered reports above, identify exactly one report per expected suffix in
   cdx, cld, grk, mus, gem, belonging to this dispatch's `research.1q.cdx`,
   `research.1q.cld`, `research.1q.grk`, `research.1q.mus`, `research.1q.gem`
   dependencies, matching by `wait_name` and the canonical research label's existing
   `__<suffix>.md` suffix. Never reassign suffixes from list order. Open the research
   repo with `/sase_repo`, then read each report through its canonical research
   reference (or the `ref` field's `file:<id>` reference if the original has moved)
   using `sase artifact read`. Do not read predecessor chat transcripts. If the records
   above do not identify exactly one report per expected suffix, stop and report the
   missing or ambiguous input instead of guessing.
2. Research the request yourself, prioritizing gaps, weak evidence, and disagreements
   between the reports.
3. Pick a descriptive stem `<name>` that collides with nothing in the month directory
   (do NOT end the name with `_consolidated` or `_<YYYYmmdd>` or anything similar unless
   it relates to the research topic), create `<month-dir>/<name>/`, and move each report
   inside it as `<name>__<suffix>.md`, preserving its existing suffix. Each report's
   `source_path` is provenance for where it lives in your own opened research checkout;
   resolve its canonical repo-relative path there before moving it. Never modify the
   other agents' checkouts or the stored snapshot recorded at `ref` — only the copy in
   your own checkout moves. Preserve every file and never overwrite: on any collision,
   pick a different stem first.
4. Write the consolidated report to `<name>/<name>__final.md`: merge the strongest
   findings from every report above and your own research, resolve conflicts, cut
   duplication, and add missing critical context without unnecessary length.

   Do not create `<name>/<name>.md`, not even as a placeholder, because the linker agent
   `research.1q.linker` publishes it from your report.

5. After the write succeeds, register the consolidated report as a durable snapshot so
   the linker agent, `research.1q.linker`, can find it:

   sase artifact create -p "<absolute-report-path>" -l
   "research:<repo-relative-report-path>"

   Use the consolidated report's actual absolute path and its path relative to the
   research repo root, for example `research:202609/<name>/<name>__final.md`. Register
   only the consolidated report, and do not pass `--move`. If registration fails, report
   that failure; do not report the task as fully complete.
