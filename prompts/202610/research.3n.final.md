%clan(research.3n, tribe=research, summary=[[[bold]RESEARCH PROMPT:[/bold] I would like
to migrate all existing agent instruction files to a single SASE.md file that defines a
spec for the agent instruction file that gets used to contruct the appropirate agent
instruction file dynamically in ephemeral workspaces before launching sase agents in
those workspaces.

  the agent_instructions_budgeted_router.md file in the research sidecar repo (e.g. Grok
  reads both AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md and codex doesn't read the ~/AGENTS.md file at
  all).
- Also, this would unlock the ability to specify that parts of the agent instruction
  file should only be rendered for certain agents. I'm not sure how we should identify
  these agents, but my first thought would be to use a new `%tag` directive to tag
  certain agents and then only render some parts of the agent instruction file for
  agents with certain tags. This is just my first instinct though. You should think hard
  about the best way to implement this.
- I think I'm probably forgetting a few other high-value use-cases (see if you can
  identify any that I missed).

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a
different approach? Make any adjustments to the requirements that you think are
justified but clearly call these out. End your analysis with a recommended solution.]])

Research request:

I would like to migrate all existing agent instruction files to a single SASE.md file
that defines a spec for the agent instruction file that gets used to contruct the
appropirate agent instruction file dynamically in ephemeral workspaces before launching
sase agents in those workspaces.

The researchers' registered reports:

{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "markdown" and a.label and a.label.startswith("research:") %}

- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} source_path={{ a.source_path }}
  path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }} {% endfor %}

Month directory (create it if missing):

$(sase repo path research --ensure)/$(date +%Y%m)

Steps:

1. From the registered reports above, identify exactly one report per expected suffix in
   cdx, cld, grk, mus, gem, belonging to this dispatch's `research.3n.cdx`,
   `research.3n.cld`, `research.3n.grk`, `research.3n.mus`, `research.3n.gem`
   dependencies, matching by `wait_name` and the canonical research label's existing
   `__<suffix>.md` suffix. Never reassign suffixes from list order. Open the research
   repo with `/sase_repo`, then read each report through its canonical research
   reference (or the `ref` field's `file:<id>` reference if the original has moved)
   using `sase artifact read`. Do not read predecessor chat transcripts. If the records
   above do not identify exactly one report per expected suffix, stop and report the
   missing or ambiguous input instead of guessing.
2. Research the request yourself, prioritizing gaps, weak evidence, and disagreements
   between the reports.
3. Pick a descriptive stem `<name>` that collides with nothing in the month directory
   (do NOT end the name with `_consolidated` or `_<YYYYmmdd>` or anything similar unless
   it relates to the research topic), create `<month-dir>/<name>/`, and move each report
   inside it as `<name>__<suffix>.md`, preserving its existing suffix. Each report's
   `source_path` is provenance for where it lives in your own opened research checkout;
   resolve its canonical repo-relative path there before moving it. Never modify the
   other agents' checkouts or the stored snapshot recorded at `ref` — only the copy in
   your own checkout moves. Preserve every file and never overwrite: on any collision,
   pick a different stem first.
4. Write the consolidated report to `<name>/<name>__final.md`: merge the strongest
   findings from every report above and your own research, resolve conflicts, cut
   duplication, and add missing critical context without unnecessary length.

   Do not create `<name>/<name>.md`, not even as a placeholder, because the linker agent
   `research.3n.linker` publishes it from your report.

5. After the write succeeds, register the consolidated report as a durable snapshot so
   the linker agent, `research.3n.linker`, can find it:

   sase artifact create -p "<absolute-report-path>" -l
   "research:<repo-relative-report-path>"

   Use the consolidated report's actual absolute path and its path relative to the
   research repo root, for example `research:202609/<name>/<name>__final.md`. Register
   only the consolidated report, and do not pass `--move`. If registration fails, report
   that failure; do not report the task as fully complete.
