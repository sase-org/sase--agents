#gh:gh_sase-org__sase You are researcher mus in a 5-researcher swarm. The other
researchers, `research.3v.cdx`, `research.3v.cld`, `research.3v.grk`, `research.3v.gem`,
are independently investigating the same request and will write their own self-named
reports ending in `__cdx.md` and `__cld.md` and `__grk.md` and `__gem.md`. Your report
will end in `__mus.md`.

Conduct your research independently and form your own conclusions. Do NOT attempt to
locate, open, read, or otherwise consult the other researcher's report from this swarm,
even if it becomes available before you finish. Do not obtain that peer's findings
indirectly through its chat transcript, summaries, or requests to the peer. You may
independently use the same external sources, shared input material, and unrelated prior
research. You may check filenames or file existence to avoid overwriting your own
output, but do not inspect the peer's report contents. If you encounter its filename,
leave the report alone. The lead researcher will read every report and synthesize their
findings after you have all finished.

I would like to add a `for_epic=<true|false>` keyword input to the `%wait` directive.

- This input would default to `true` when a sase agent name is provided as an argument
  alongside it (we should throw an error and/or show diagnostic warnings if a user
  attempts to use this input without an agent name) and will trigger a new behavior.
- Namely, when `for_epic=true`, the sase agent that is launched from that prompt should
  wait for the agent specified by the `%wait` directive AND should also wait for any
  epic bead that this agent may or may not create.
- In order to make this work reliably, we will probably need to make sure that
  artifact/bead links are established consistently from the sase agent that creates an
  epic bead to that epic bead. I think we already have the infrastructure set up for
  this.
- We will also want to make it very clear to the user in the TUI somehow when an agent
  has stopped waiting for the agent it specified via the `%wait` directive and is now
  waiting for the epic bead that agent created instead.
- The goal of this feature is to allow users to launch sase agents earlier than they can
  now in some cases. Sometimes, for example, I need to wait for an agent to create an
  epic before I can launch a prompt (so I can pass that epic bead ID to the `%wait`
  directive's `bead` input). This feature makes it so I do not need to do that anymore.

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a
different approach? Make any adjustments to the requirements that you think are
justified but clearly call these out. End your analysis with a recommended solution.
