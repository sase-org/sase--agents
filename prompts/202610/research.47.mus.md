#gh:gh_sase-org__sase You are researcher mus in a 5-researcher swarm. The other
researchers, `research.47.cdx`, `research.47.cld`, `research.47.grk`, `research.47.gem`,
are independently investigating the same request and will write their own self-named
reports ending in `__cdx.md` and `__cld.md` and `__grk.md` and `__gem.md`. Your report
will end in `__mus.md`.

Conduct your research independently and form your own conclusions. Do NOT attempt to
locate, open, read, or otherwise consult the other researcher's report from this swarm,
even if it becomes available before you finish. Do not obtain that peer's findings
indirectly through its chat transcript, summaries, or requests to the peer. You may
independently use the same external sources, shared input material, and unrelated prior
research. You may check filenames or file existence to avoid overwriting your own
output, but do not inspect the peer's report contents. If you encounter its filename,
leave the report alone. The lead researcher will read every report and synthesize their
findings after you have all finished.

A number of sase agents just failed on this machine with the following error:
`ImportError: cannot import name 'auto_launch_prefix' from 'sase.monitor.continuation_delivery'`

- This error was clearly caused by updating sase while agents were running, which is
  something I would like to support.
- I would like to start automatically detecting errors like this and attempting to
  automatically resolve the issue by dismissing and re-launching the sase agent that
  failed.
- We should try to restart an agent exactly once when a detected error pattern matches.
  Think hard about which error patterns we should check for.
- This operation should be very similar to what happens when the user selects a failed
  agent on the "Agents" tab, uses the `,x` keymap to dismiss and edit it, and then
  submitting the prompt (e.g. via the `<ctrl+g><enter>` keymap) that loads in the prompt
  input widget without modifying it.
- We should send an excellent and thorough sase notification to the user when we restart
  a failed agent like this.

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a
different approach? Make any adjustments to the requirements that you think are
justified but clearly call these out. End your analysis with a recommended solution.
