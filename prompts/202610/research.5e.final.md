%clan(research.5e, tribe=research, summary=[[[bold]RESEARCH PROMPT:[/bold] There is not
nearly enough transparancy about how the load is determined for the current machine. For
example, in the ~/tmp/screenshots/20261026_172751.png screenshot you can see that there
are 6 agents running (from the agent count at the top), but the load is only at 3/8.
This seems like it is probably a mistake/bug (I only see 1 agent that is running a
waiting monitor, so I would expect a load of 5 I think--I'm not sure), but the bigger
problem is that it is very unclear what error we are making right now, if any (which
nodes do not have any weight associated with them, for example).

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide on the best UX changes to
make this state clearer and helping to resolve the issues with the way the machine's
load is calculated (if any)? End your analysis with a recommended UX and solutions to
any issues you find with machine load calculations.]]) %id:research.5e.final %m:@xlarge

When you author or carry over Mermaid diagrams, load `/mermaid_diagrams` before
drafting, even when no image or diagrams companion runs. The skill has the shared
figure-selection, styling, and PDF-render review rules. If the provider skill is not
deployed, verify the edited plugin's guide with
`sase macro show skill/mermaid_diagrams --format raw` (or
`sase macro show /mermaid_diagrams --format raw`) and use the form this host supports.
This guidance does not enable a companion diagrams agent.

The researchers' registered reports:

{% for a in wait.artifacts if a.kind == "markdown" and a.label and a.label.startswith("research:") %}

- wait_name={{ a.wait_name }} label={{ a.label }} source_path={{ a.source_path }}
  path={{ a.path }} ref={{ a.ref }} {% endfor %}

Month directory (create it if missing):

$(sase repo path research --ensure)/$(date +%Y%m)

Steps:

1. From the registered reports above, identify exactly one report per expected suffix in
   cdx, cld, grk, mus, gem, belonging to this dispatch's `research.5e.cdx`,
   `research.5e.cld`, `research.5e.grk`, `research.5e.mus`, `research.5e.gem`
   dependencies, matching by `wait_name` and the canonical research label's existing
   `__<suffix>.md` suffix. Never reassign suffixes from list order. Open the research
   repo with `/sase_repo`, then read each report through its canonical research
   reference (or the `ref` field's `file:<id>` reference if the original has moved)
   using `sase artifact read`. Do not read predecessor chat transcripts. If the records
   above do not identify exactly one report per expected suffix, stop and report the
   missing or ambiguous input instead of guessing.
2. Research the request yourself, prioritizing gaps, weak evidence, and disagreements
   between the reports.
3. Pick a descriptive stem `<name>` that collides with nothing in the month directory
   (do NOT end the name with `_consolidated` or `_<YYYYmmdd>` or anything similar unless
   it relates to the research topic), create `<month-dir>/<name>/`, and move each report
   inside it as `<name>__<suffix>.md`, preserving its existing suffix. Each report's
   `source_path` is provenance for where it lives in your own opened research checkout;
   resolve its canonical repo-relative path there before moving it. Never modify the
   other agents' checkouts or the stored snapshot recorded at `ref` — only the copy in
   your own checkout moves. Preserve every file and never overwrite: on any collision,
   pick a different stem first.
4. Write the consolidated report to `<name>/<name>__final.md`: merge the strongest
   findings from every report above and your own research, resolve conflicts, cut
   duplication, and add missing critical context without unnecessary length.

   Do not create `<name>/<name>.md`, not even as a placeholder, because the linker agent
   `research.5e.linker` publishes it from your report.

5. After the write succeeds, register the consolidated report as a durable snapshot so
   the linker agent, `research.5e.linker`, can find it:

   sase artifact create -p "<absolute-report-path>" -l
   "research:<repo-relative-report-path>"

   Use the consolidated report's actual absolute path and its path relative to the
   research repo root, for example `research:202609/<name>/<name>__final.md`. Register
   only the consolidated report, and do not pass `--move`. If registration fails, report
   that failure; do not report the task as fully complete.
