#gh:gh_sase-org__sase You are researcher mus in a 5-researcher swarm. The other
researchers, `research.46.cdx`, `research.46.cld`, `research.46.grk`, `research.46.gem`,
are independently investigating the same request and will write their own self-named
reports ending in `__cdx.md` and `__cld.md` and `__grk.md` and `__gem.md`. Your report
will end in `__mus.md`.

Conduct your research independently and form your own conclusions. Do NOT attempt to
locate, open, read, or otherwise consult the other researcher's report from this swarm,
even if it becomes available before you finish. Do not obtain that peer's findings
indirectly through its chat transcript, summaries, or requests to the peer. You may
independently use the same external sources, shared input material, and unrelated prior
research. You may check filenames or file existence to avoid overwriting your own
output, but do not inspect the peer's report contents. If you encounter its filename,
leave the report alone. The lead researcher will read every report and synthesize their
findings after you have all finished.

I would like to make my macbook (which is not a powerful machine) the main driver of
sase's TUI by finishing the implementation for remote machine support.

- Because my mac has low resources, I probably won't run many agents on that machine.
  I'm fine with needing to manually specify the `%dispatch` directive (whcih we should
  add a `%d` short-hand for) when launching remote agents from sase's TUI on my macbook
  for now.
- I need to be able to reliably perform EVERY agent operation that I can currently
  perform from the "Agents" tab on local agents on remote agents as well.
- It is fine if remote agent data is slow to sync locally (or even exclusively manual
  via a new keymap that syncs the currently selected remote machine's data, which we
  should add anyway, if necessary to keep my macbook from using too many resources) as
  long as ALL of that data is able to be synced and displayed in the TUI on my macbook.

Can you do some research with the goal of helping me decide the best way to implement
this? Also, critique this plan in general. Is this a good idea? Would you take a
different approach? Make any adjustments to the requirements that you think are
justified but clearly call these out. End your analysis with a recommended solution.
